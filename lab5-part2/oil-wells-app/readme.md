## Lab 5 Part 1 - Oil Wells Data Extraction

### Important Files and Folders

1. **`.env`**: File with environment variables.
2. **`requirements.txt`**: File with dependencies to be installed for the project.
3. **`docs/`**: Documentation including meeting minutes and README in PDF format.
4. **`notebooks/`**: Experimental usage and testing of concepts.

### Setup

1. Navigate to the `oil-wells-data-scraper` directory:
   ```bash
   cd oil-wells-data-scraper
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or "venv\Scripts\activate" on Windows
   ```

3. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Script

1. Ensure that:
   - All the important files and folders listed above are present at the correct location.
   - The virtual environment is created and activated.

2. To run the script:
   - Move into the `/src` directory:
     ```bash
     cd src
     ```
   - Execute the `<file_name>.py` script:
     ```bash
     python <file_name>.py
     ```

### Execution Flow

1. **PDF Extraction and Conversion**:
   - Run `pdf2txt.py` to download PDF files from Google Drive, convert them into small-sized text files, and store them locally for further processing.

2. **Data Processing and Database Ingestion**:
   - Run `ingest.py` to process raw text files, extract relevant information, back it up in the database, filter out usable columns, extract additional data from URLs present in raw data, validate the data, and push it into the database.
