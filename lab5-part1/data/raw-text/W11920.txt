Dear Jason,
Our conversation on May 2, 2014 discussed flood preparations for wells that your company operates
near Williston, North Dakota. The Missouri River continues to rise and the possibility of additional
flooding from the spring melt and recent rains in the near future exists. I urge you to closely monitor
these sites and take the necessary preventative actions to eliminate or mitigate environmental damage
if these sites become deluged with flood waters. The following e-mail from Allen Schlag of the National
Weather Service also addresses the current situation of the Missouri River in the Williston area:

Subject: Missouri River
Greetings everyone
Just a quick note on the Missouri River near Williston forecast site and the prospects for problems as
we go forward into latter half of May and early June {by default this also includes the Yellowstone in
ND as well). As you may have noticed already, the Missouri River near Williston crossed over into
Forecast Issuance Stage this past weekend before falling back below 20 ft. This, is temporary. While
the Corps released a statement last week tempering their runoff expectations for the Missouri River
overall, the attached graphic of mountain snowpack suggests we still have a pretty strong runoff into
the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers ahead of us.
We will most likely cross over above flood stage as measured at the Lewis and Clark Bridge west of
Williston at some point in the next couple of weeks.
What exactly lies in store for the area with respect to eventual river stages is still quite unclear as the
overall environment for the melt of the mountain snowpack is too far out. However. .. there has been
a fairly wet pattern in the plains of Montana already this spring, with a mixed bag in the upper
elevations of central MT. The region remains well above normal with respect to mountain snowpack,
but is also well below where 1997 and 2011 were at this point in time {see the second attached pdf).
If I had to take a wild guess this far in advance, something around the 22.5 to 24.5 ft range is
reasonable, with any added big rains this could be expanded quite easily to the 25-26 ft range.
How exactly this will compare to this spring's ice jams and high water is a really good question, which I
don't have any easy answers to either. Suffice to say, I think there's a pretty decent chance that we
will see water roughly 4-6 ft higher than is currently in northwestern ND along both the Yellowstone
and Missouri Rivers with the timing of near the last week of May to about the third week of June.
Historically, I know there have been some access issues with oil well sites in the Trenton area with
water levels in the 22 ft range at the Lewis and Clark Bridge. How much of this has been mitigated by
ring dikes or road raises, again ... very good question to which I have no answer.
Of course, if you have any questions or just want to chat about this in greater detail, always feel free
to give me a call.
Allen
