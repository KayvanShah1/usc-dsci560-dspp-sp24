North Dakota.
INTRODUCTION
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T [Lot 3 Section 18,
T153N, R100W] is located in Baker Field of the Williston Basin in western North Dakota. This
section lies approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston and adjacent to Lake
Sakakawea in McKenzie County. The Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T is a horizontal First Bench
Three Forks well, in a double-section, laydown spacing unit permitted to drill to the east from
the surface location within Section 18, continuing through Section 17 to the proposed bottom-
hole location (PBHL) in that section. There are 200â setbacks along the north and south borders
and 500â setbacks from the east and west borders within the 1,280 acre spacing unit. The well
consists of one Three Forks lateral. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to approximately
10,293â. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100â to land within the First Bench Three
Forks. Directional drilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the
Three Forks reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock. Oasis Petroleum is
targeting a dolomite shale facies of the Three Forks Formation with intent to intersect porosity
and fracture trends enhancing reservoir quality.OFFSET WELLS
Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the âControl
Dataâ section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in providing control data,
making it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and landing target depth. By
referencing the gamma signature of these offsets, a model was formed for the target interval
pinpointing a strategic landing. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in
these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in order to
successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was periodically
updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.
GEOLOGY
The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,391' MD 9,390'
TVD (-7,357' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was
described as light gray, light brown to brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime
mudstone was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rare crystalline texture. Some
intervals contained a trace of black-brown algal material, traces of fossil fragments, and traces of
disseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as light
gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The
argillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture.
Some intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. The highest gas shows were 71 to 112
units and 53 units of connection gas in the Mission Canyon. Rare intercrystalline porosity was
noted as well as trace spotty light brown oil stain while logging the Mission Canyon Formation.
The Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,737' MD
10,671' TVD (-8,638' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray carbonaceous and
petroliferous shale was hard with a sub blocky to sub platy texture. Fracture porosity was noted,
and trace minerals were observed including disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill.
Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 367 units of drilling gas.
The Middle Bakken Member [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,766'
MD 10,687' TVD (-8,654' SS) which was 9â high to the Oasis Petroleum North America LLC
Chalmers 5300 21-19 8T. Samples in the Middle Bakken Member were predominantly silty
sandstone which was described as light gray brown, light brown, trace light gray in color. It was
very fine grained, friable, subrounded, smooth, moderately sorted, and moderately calcite
cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was fair intergranular
porosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain. Hydrocarbons
evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 292 units of drilling gas.
The Lower Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,850' MD
10,729' TVD (-8,696' SS). Entry into this interval was characterized by high gamma, elevated
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The carbonaceous black, black gray shale is
petroliferous, hard, splintery, smooth and exhibits possible fracture porosity. Trace minerals
included disseminated pyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 339 units.The Pronghorn Member [Devonian-Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,876' MD 10,740' TVD
(-8,707' SS). Entry into this interval was characterized by lower gamma, and slightly slower
penetration rates. Samples from the Pronghorn were described as siltstone which was dark gray
trace gray black and friable to firm. This siltstone was moderately dolomite cemented and
included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Also noted was a trace of spotty light brown oil stain.
Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 250 units.
The Three Forks [Devonian] was reached at 10,916' MD 10,754' TVD (-8,721' SS) which was -
16â high to the Oasis Petroleum North America LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 8T. The target zone
of the Three Forks was to be drilled in a predominately 16 foot zone beginning 12 feet into the
Three Forks and representing the 1st Bench.
Samples in the Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as light brown-
light brown gray, tan-cream, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a microsucrosic
texture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline porosity. Also
noted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was light green-light
gray green, mint green shale that was firm, sub blocky, with an earthy texture. Occasional
disseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.
Dry sample of predominantly dolomite and shale from the Three Forks 1st Bench target zone.Hydrocarbon Shows
Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during
the drilling of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in
samples were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were
maintained near balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas
varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which may have reflected
increased porosity. During the vertical, gas peaks of 42 to 301 units were noted, against a 9.7-
10.4 ppg diesel-invert mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 132 to
1,895 units, against a 9.6-9.65 lb/gal saltwater gel drilling fluid. Chromatography of gas revealed
typical concentrations of methane, characteristic of First Bench Three Forks gas.

latoTThe 920â curve was drilled in 24 hours, circulating time. The assembly used to complete the
curve consisted of bit #5; a Security MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV
stage 7/8 5.0 motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed at 11,120â MD and
10,772â TVD, approximately 18â into the Three Forks. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110
intermediate casing was set to 11,095â MD.
Geologic structure maps of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T and surrounding control wells had
estimated gross formation dip to be down at approximately 0.2Âº. The preferred drilling interval
consisted of a thirteen foot zone of dolomite and shale and a 3â zone of Claystone located
approximately twelve feet into the Three Forks. Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data,
and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred stratigraphic position
in the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis representatives, projected porosity
zones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.
Offset well target definition for the Three Forks 1st Bench, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).
Steering decisions were made by using the low gamma in the lower portion of the target zone to
establish the well-boreâs position in the target zone. If the well-bore moved lower, the higher
gamma of the underlying claystone (G) was observed, as was the presence of claystone in
collected samples. Slides were then utilized to move the well-bore back up into the target zone.
As the well-bore moved higher, approaching the top of the target zone the high to medium
fluctuating gamma (D) was noted. Samples in the lower gamma portion of the target zone
contained noticeably greater concentrations of the light brown-light brown gray, tan-cream, trace
pink dolomite; as the well-bore moved higher in zone the samples tended to have more of the
light gray, off white, gray brown dolomite. This lateral was drilled in 4 and a half days from
casing exit to TD, with two lateral assemblies. The TD of 20,542â MD was achieved at 17:15
hours CDT May 7, 2015. The wellbore was completed with 100% of the lateral in target,opening 9,447â (measurement taken from uncased lateral portion) of potentially productive
reservoir rock. The hole was then circulated and reamed for completion.
SUMMARY
The Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T is a successful well in Oasis Petroleumâs horizontal 1st Bench
Three Forks development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to
TD in a little over 17 days. The TD of 20,542â MD was achieved at 17:15 hours CDT May 7,
2015. The well site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval
for 100% of the lateral, opening 9,447â of potentially productive reservoir rock.
Samples in the First Bench Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as
light brown-light brown gray, tan-cream, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a
microsucrosic texture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline
porosity. Also noted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was
light green-light gray green, mint green shale that was firm, sub blocky, with an earthy texture.
Occasional disseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.
Gas on the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T varied according to stratigraphic position and
penetration rates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and hydrocarbon
shows were encouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Three Forks.
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T awaits completion
operations to determine its ultimate production potential.

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC
Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T
Rig crews caught 100â sample intervals, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, from 4,700â to
8,240â; 30â intervals from 8,240â, to the TD of the lateral at 20,542â. Formation tops and lithologic
markers have been inserted into the sample descriptions below for reference. Sample descriptions begin
in the Belle Fourche Formation. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope.
Sample fluorescent cuts are masked by invert mud through intermediate casing. Quantifiers in order of
increasing abundance are trace, rare, occasional, common and abundant.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis Petroleum North America LLC (OPNA) requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the
referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. OPNA Intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud
and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth
pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used In the
drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical
seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of
drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing
plan as per the APO. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations In accordance
with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03Â·55 of the NDAC, Is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings
and time savings of using an Initial rig that Is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not
Intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with
acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. OPNA understands NDAC 43-02-03Â·31
requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately, as site
conditions allow, after construction if the well pad Is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1 ). OPNA will
notify the NDIC and work on an alternative solution if unforeseen circumstances prevent the rig from returning to
drill prior to the 90 extension expiration.

RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
KLINE FEDERAL 5300 31-18 15T
LOT3 Section 18-153N-100W
McKenzie County
Well File # 30789
Dear Victoria:
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 17 & 18 T153N R100W.
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are
conducted. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-
3554 prior to location construction. Due to surficial water adjacent to the well site, a dike is required
surrounding the entire location.
Drilling pit
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that âa pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings
pit.â
Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10108 E.
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.Victoria Siemieniewski

Permit Fee & Notification
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the
Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a
message if after hours or on the weekend.
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.
Surface casing cement
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.
Logs
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to
digitallogs@nd.gov
Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells
Dear Operator,
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:
ï· leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container
ï· covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container
ï· placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
Bruce E. Hicks

hole location (PBHL) in that section. There are 200â setbacks along the north and south borders 
and 500â setbacks from the east and west borders within the 1,280 acre spacing unit. The well 
consists of one Three Forks lateral. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to approximately 
10,293â. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100â to land within the First Bench Three 
Forks. Directional drilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the 
Three Forks reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.  Oasis Petroleum is 
targeting a dolomite shale facies of the Three Forks Formation with intent to intersect porosity 
and fracture trends enhancing reservoir quality. 
OFFSET WELLS  
 
Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the âControl 
Dataâ section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in providing control data, 
making it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and landing target depth. By 
referencing the gamma signature of these offsets, a model was formed for the target interval 
pinpointing a strategic landing.  Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in 
these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in order to 
successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was periodically 
updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.  
 
GEOLOGY 
 
The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,391' MD 9,390' 
TVD (-7,357' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was 
described as light gray, light brown to brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime 
mudstone was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rare crystalline texture. Some 
intervals contained a trace of black-brown algal material, traces of fossil fragments, and traces of 
disseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as light 
gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The 
argillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture. 
Some intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. The highest gas shows were 71 to 112 
units and 53 units of connection gas in the Mission Canyon. Rare intercrystalline porosity was 
noted as well as trace spotty light brown oil stain while logging the Mission Canyon Formation. 
                              
The Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,737' MD 
10,671' TVD (-8,638' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated 
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray carbonaceous and 
petroliferous shale was hard with a sub blocky to sub platy texture. Fracture porosity was noted, 
and trace minerals were observed including disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill. 
Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 367 units of drilling gas. 
                                                                               
The Middle Bakken Member [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,766' 
MD 10,687' TVD (-8,654' SS) which was 9â high to the Oasis Petroleum North America LLC 
Chalmers 5300 21-19 8T. Samples in the Middle Bakken Member were predominantly silty 
sandstone which was described as light gray brown, light brown, trace light gray in color. It was 
very fine grained, friable, subrounded, smooth, moderately sorted, and moderately calcite 
cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was fair intergranular 
porosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain. Hydrocarbons 
evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 292 units of drilling gas. 
 
The Lower Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,850' MD 
10,729' TVD (-8,696' SS). Entry into this interval was characterized by high gamma, elevated 
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The carbonaceous black, black gray shale is 
petroliferous, hard, splintery, smooth and exhibits possible fracture porosity. Trace minerals 
included disseminated pyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 339 units. 
 
The Pronghorn Member [Devonian-Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,876' MD 10,740' TVD 
(-8,707' SS). Entry into this interval was characterized by lower gamma, and slightly slower 
penetration rates. Samples from the Pronghorn were described as siltstone which was dark gray 
trace gray black and friable to firm. This siltstone was moderately dolomite cemented and 
included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Also noted was a trace of spotty light brown oil stain. 
Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 250 units. 
 
The Three Forks [Devonian] was reached at 10,916' MD 10,754' TVD (-8,721' SS) which was -
16â high to the Oasis Petroleum North America LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 8T. The target zone 
of the Three Forks was to be drilled in a predominately 16 foot zone beginning 12 feet into the 
Three Forks and representing the 1st Bench. 
 
Samples in the Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as light brown-
light brown gray, tan-cream, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a microsucrosic 
texture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline porosity. Also 
noted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was light green-light 
gray green, mint green shale that was firm, sub blocky, with an earthy texture. Occasional 
disseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.

Hydrocarbon Shows  
 
Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during 
the drilling of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in 
samples were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were 
maintained near balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas 
varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which may have reflected 
increased porosity. During the vertical, gas peaks of 42 to 301 units were noted, against a 9.7-
10.4 ppg diesel-invert mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 132 to 
1,895 units, against a 9.6-9.65 lb/gal saltwater gel drilling fluid. Chromatography of gas revealed 
typical concentrations of methane, characteristic of First Bench Three Forks gas.

Geosteering 
 
Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling 
(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers, MWD, and Sunburst Consulting personnel 
worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to 
maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of 
the formation.

The 920â curve was drilled in 24 hours, circulating time. The assembly used to complete the 
curve consisted of bit #5; a Security MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV 
stage 7/8 5.0 motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed at 11,120â MD and 
10,772â TVD, approximately 18â into the Three Forks. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110 
intermediate casing was set to 11,095â MD.  
 
Geologic structure maps of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T and surrounding control wells had 
estimated gross formation dip to be down at approximately 0.2Âº. The preferred drilling interval 
consisted of a thirteen foot zone of dolomite and shale and a 3â zone of Claystone located 
approximately twelve feet into the Three Forks. Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data, 
and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred stratigraphic position 
in the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis representatives, projected porosity 
zones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.  
 
 
 
 Offset well target definition for the Three Forks 1st Bench, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).   
 
Steering decisions were made by using the low gamma in the lower portion of the target zone to 
establish the well-boreâs position in the target zone. If the well-bore moved lower, the higher 
gamma of the underlying claystone (G) was observed, as was the presence of claystone in 
collected samples. Slides were then utilized to move the well-bore back up into the target zone. 
As the well-bore moved higher, approaching the top of the target zone the high to medium 
fluctuating gamma (D) was noted. Samples in the lower gamma portion of the target zone 
contained noticeably greater concentrations of the light brown-light brown gray, tan-cream, trace 
pink dolomite; as the well-bore moved higher in zone the samples tended to have more of the 
light gray, off white, gray brown dolomite. This lateral was drilled in 4 and a half days from 
casing exit to TD, with two lateral assemblies. The TD of 20,542â MD was achieved at 17:15 
hours CDT May 7, 2015. The wellbore was completed with 100% of the lateral in target, 
opening 9,447â (measurement taken from uncased lateral portion) of potentially productive 
reservoir rock. The hole was then circulated and reamed for completion. 
 
SUMMARY  
 
The Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T is a successful well in Oasis Petroleumâs horizontal 1st Bench 
Three Forks development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to 
TD in a little over 17 days. The TD of 20,542â MD was achieved at 17:15 hours CDT May 7, 
2015. The well site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval 
for 100% of the lateral, opening 9,447â of potentially productive reservoir rock.  
 
Samples in the First Bench Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as 
light brown-light brown gray, tan-cream, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a 
microsucrosic texture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline 
porosity. Also noted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was 
light green-light gray green, mint green shale that was firm, sub blocky, with an earthy texture. 
Occasional disseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.      
 
Gas on the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T varied according to stratigraphic position and 
penetration rates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and hydrocarbon 
shows were encouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Three Forks. 
 
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T awaits completion 
operations to determine its ultimate production potential.

Rig crews caught 100â sample intervals, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, from 4,700â to 
8,240â; 30â intervals from 8,240â, to the TD of the lateral at 20,542â. Formation tops and lithologic 
markers have been inserted into the sample descriptions below for reference.  Sample descriptions begin 
in the Belle Fourche Formation.  Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope. 
Sample fluorescent cuts are masked by invert mud through intermediate casing. Quantifiers in order of 
increasing abundance are trace, rare, occasional, common and abundant.

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC (OPNA) requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the 
referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. OPNA Intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud 
and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth 
pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used In the 
drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical 
seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of 
drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing 
plan as per the APO. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations In accordance 
with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03Â·55 of the NDAC, Is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings 
and time savings of using an Initial rig that Is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not 
Intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with 
acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. OPNA understands NDAC 43-02-03Â·31 
requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately, as site 
conditions allow, after construction if the well pad Is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1 ). OPNA will 
notify the NDIC and work on an alternative solution if unforeseen circumstances prevent the rig from returning to 
drill prior to the 90 extension expiration.

Well File # 30789 
 
Dear Victoria: 
 
   Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The 
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than 
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 17 & 18 T153N R100W.  
 
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for 
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must 
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are 
conducted.  OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-
3554 prior to location construction.  Due to surficial water adjacent to the well site, a dike is required 
surrounding the entire location. 
 
Drilling pit 
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that âa pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well 
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will 
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits 
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings 
pit.â 
 
Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines  
  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum 
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10108 E. 
 
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) 
   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the 
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to 
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may 
be waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information 
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other 
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the 
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification 
   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested 
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the 
Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal 
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are 
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a 
message if after hours or on the weekend.  
 
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells 
   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor 
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys 
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may 
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the 
operation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe 
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve 
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. 
 
Surface casing cement 
 
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi 
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.   
 
Logs 
 
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and 
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and 
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation 
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log 
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to 
digitallogs@nd.gov 
   
Thank you for your cooperation.

RE:  Filter Socks and Other Filter Media 
 
 
 
 
Leakproof Container Required 
 
 
 
 
Oil and Gas Wells 
 
Dear Operator, 
 
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with 
exploration or production of oil and  gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all 
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations. 
 
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota.  The Commission is very 
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. 
 
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the 
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations 
are conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an 
authorized facility.  Such containers must be: 
ï· 
leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container 
ï· 
covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container 
ï· 
placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container 
 
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but 
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. 
 
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production 
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste 
Management.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the 
solid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, 
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  
 
Thank you for your cooperation.  
 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
 
Bruce E. Hicks
