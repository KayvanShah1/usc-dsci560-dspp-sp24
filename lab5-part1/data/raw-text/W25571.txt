DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests a waiver from the tubing/pkr requirement included in
NDAC 43-02-03-21: Casing, tubing, and cementing requirements during the completion period immediately
following the upcoming fracture stimulation.
The following assurances apply:
1. The well is equipped with new 29# & 32# casing at surface with an API burst rating of 11,220 psi
2. The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.85 API burst rating to determine the maximum pressure.
3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment.
4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flow back than during the frac job.
5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates.
6. Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing.
7. A 300# gauge will be installed on the surface casing during the flowback period.

INTRODUCTION
Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Colville 5301 44-12T [SE SE Sec. 12-T153N-R101W] is
located approximately 3 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The
Colville 5301 44-12T is a horizontal Three Forks development well in part of Oasis Petroleum’s
Camp prospect within the Williston Basin. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to
approximately 10,333’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the Three
Forks. This well is a two section lateral which originates in the southeast quarter of section 12,
then drilled south across section 13, to the southeast quarter of section 24 (Figure 2). Directional
drilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the upper Three Forks
reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.
OFFSET WELLS
The primary offset wells used for depth correlation during curve operations were the Gulf Oil
Exploration and Production, Lindvig 1-11-3C; and the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC
Ash Federal 5300 11-18T. The Gulf Oil Exploration and Production, Lindvig 1-11-3C [SE SE
Sec. 11, T153N, R101W] is located approximately ½ of a mile west of the Colville 5301 44-12T.
This well was completed in March of 1982 reached a total depth of 13,800’ true vertical depth
(TVD). The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Ash Federal 5300 11-18T [Lot 1 Section 18,T153N, R100W] is located approximately east north east of the Colville 5301 44-12T. This well
was drilled to the Three Forks landing of 10,794’ MD in August and September of 2012. The
formation thicknesses expressed by gamma signatures in these wells, and the Oasis Petroleum
North America, LLC Larry 5301 44-12B [SE NE Section 12, T153N, R101W] were used to
assist in landing the curve. This was accomplished by comparing gamma signatures from the
offset wells to gamma data collected during drilling operations. The casing target landing was
periodically updated to ensure accurate landing of the curve. Data used in this evaluation are
included as an appendix to this report.

GEOLOGY
Lithology
The Ratcliffe interval [Charles Formation] was drilled at 9,228' MD 9,227' TVD (-7,142') SS.
The top of this interval was observed as faster penetration rates were encountered, as the well
bore transitioned from anhydrite to limestone. This limestone was tan to gray tan, light brown
gray, occasional light brown, rare off white lime mudstone. This facies was microcrystalline,
firm, with an earthy to crystalline texture, as well as contained traces of disseminated pyrite.
Also noted in certain areas was a trace light brown oil stain; possible earthy to intercrystalline
porosity may have been present
The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 9,420' MD 9,419'
TVD (-7,334') SS. The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of lime mudstone that was
described as light brown, light gray brown to brown, occasional cream, rare light gray, trace off
white to white in color. The Mission Canyon was predominately friable to firm, dense with an
earthy to crystalline texture. Some intervals were trace siliceous with traces of disseminatedpyrite. Fossil fragments, along with black, dark brown algal laminations and a trace of stylolites
were visible in some samples throughout the Mission Canyon Formation. Following connections
or periods of non-circulation, gas shows of 39 to 46 units were noted and a trace to rare spotty
light to medium brown spotty oil stain was occasionally observed while logging the Mission
Canyon Formation.
Figure 3. Limestone with spotty light to medium brown staining from the Mission Canyon Formation.
The Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,762' MD
10,699' TVD (-8,614') SS. Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black carbonaceous and petroliferous
shale was sub blocky and firm with an earthy texture. Trace minerals were observed to include
disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill. Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a
maximum of 305 units.
The Bakken Middle Member [Mississippian-Devonian] was reached at 10,792' MD 10,715' TVD
(-8,630') SS. This formation was predominantly siltstone and silty sandstone noted by the
decreasing penetration rates, gamma API counts, and recorded gas levels, relative to the
overlying source rock. The siltstone was light gray, sub-platy to sub-blocky, with an earthy
texture. It was moderately calcite cemented, with traces of disseminated pyrite. Also present was
silty sandstone which was light gray, light gray tan, rare buff, firm, very fine grained, well
sorted, friable, sub-angular to sub-round, and contained possible intergranular porosity. It was
moderately calcite cemented. Trace minerals included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Drilling
gas in this interval reached a maximum of 145 units, with a connection gas of 256 units. Also
observed was spotty light brown spotty oil stain.Figure 4. Sample from the Lower Bakken Shale Member
The Lower Bakken Shale Member [Devonian] was reached at 10,878' MD 10,758' TVD (-8,673')
SS. This was 19’ low to the Lindvig 1-11-3C. Entry into this interval was characterized by high
gamma, elevated background gas and increased rates of penetration. The carbonaceous black,
black gray shale is petroliferous, with a blocky texture and exhibits possible fracture porosity.
Trace minerals included disseminated pyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of
312 units with a connection gas of 311 units.
The Pronghorn Member [Devonian-Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,906' MD 10,769' TVD
(-8,684') SS. Entry into this interval was characterized by lower gamma, and slightly slower
penetration rates. Samples from the Pronghorn were described as siltstone which was medium to
dark gray, gray brown, friable, sub-platy to sub-blocky, with an earthy texture. This siltstone was
moderately dolomite cemented and included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Drilling gas in this
interval reached a maximum of 196 units with a connection gas of 278 units.
The Three Forks Formation [Devonian] was reached at 10,949' MD 10,783 TVD (-8,698') SS.
The target zone of the Three Forks was to be drilled in a predominatly dolomite eight foot zone
beginning 16 feet into the Three Forks Formation.
Figure 5 & 6. Sample of the predominately dolomitic facies in the preferred drilling zone of the Three Forks
formation on left; sample from a brief contact with underlying claystone on the right.Samples in the Three Forks were commonly dolomite which is tan, cream, occasional light
brown, rare light gray tan, trace light gray. Additionally this facies was friable and dense with an
earthy texture. It also contained a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Possible
intercrystalline porosity was observed, as was a rare to a trace of light brown spotty oil stain.
Present in varying amounts was light gray to off white, rare light green shale which was friable
to firm, sub-blocky with an earthy texture. Trace of nodular and disseminated pyrite was noted in
the shale which contained no visible porosity.
Gas Show
Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during
the drilling of the Yukon 5301 41-12T. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples were
continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained near
balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas on the Colville
5301 44-12T varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which may have
reflected increased porosity. Background concentrations ranged from 300 to 600 units, and
connection peaks of 1,000 to 1,200 units were observed in the middle of the target zone. A trip at
19,527’ MD, yielded a trip gas of 1,545 units. Chromatography of gas revealed typical
concentrations of methane, ethane, propane and butane characteristic of Bakken and Three Forks
gas (Figure 7).

Geo-steering
Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling
(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers MWD and Sunburst Consulting personnel
worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to
maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of
the formation.
The 873’ curve was drilled in 24 hours with bit #2 a Security FXD55D, attached to a 2.38 degree
fixed NOV 7/8 5 stage mud motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed at
11,173’ MD, approximately 25’ into the Three Forks Formation. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-
110 casing was set to 11,144’ MD.
Geologic structure maps of the Colville 5301 44-12T and surrounding control wells, estimated
formational dip to move down at approximately -0.3º initially, then reverse due to a plunging
syncline at about 2,500’, reversing to an estimated 0.5º to 1.0º until total depth (TD) was
reached. The Colville 5301 44-12T preferred drilling interval consisted of an eight foot zone
located approximately sixteen feet into the Three Forks Formation. Stratigraphic position in the
target zone was based on penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data and sample observations.
The projected target landing was to be sixteen feet into the Three Forks and was successfully
reached prior to casing operations. Using offsets provided by Oasis representatives, projected
porosity zones were identified as the preferred drilling areas (Figure 9).

Steering decisions were made by using the higher gamma, of the underlying claystone, the low
gamma located in the middle to higher portion of the drilling zone, and the fluctuating high to
medium gamma located at the top of the drilling zone.
The TD of 21,090’ MD was achieved at 1720 hours CDT on August 12, 2013. The well site team
worked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 76% of the
lateral, opening 10,141’ of potentially productive reservoir rock. The hole was then circulated
and reamed for completion.SUMMARY
The Colville 5301 44-12T is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Three Forks
development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD in 21
days. The TD of 21,090’ MD was achieved at 1720 hours CDT August 12, 2013. The well site
team worked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 76% of the
lateral, opening 10,141’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.
Diesel invert drilling fluid 9.5-10.1 ppg for the vertical hole and 10.15-10.4 ppg for curve
operations were used to maintain stable hole conditions, minimize washout through the salt
intervals and permit adequate analysis of mud gas concentrations.
Samples in the Three Forks were commonly dolomite which is tan, cream, occasional light
brown, rare light gray tan, trace light gray. Additionally this facies was friable and dense with an
earthy texture. It also contained a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Possible
intercrystalline porosity was observed, as was a rare to a trace of light brown spotty oil stain.
Present in varying amounts was light gray to off white, rare light green shale which was friable
to firm, sub-blocky with an earthy texture. Trace of nodular and disseminated pyrite was noted,
and the shale contained no visible porosity.
Gas on the Colville 5301 44-12T varied according to penetration rates and stratigraphic position
of the well bore. Observed concentrations of background gas ranged from 300 to 600 units, and
connection peaks of 1,000 to 1,200 units were observed in the middle portion of formation while
drilling in the lateral where shows were the best. A trip at 19,527’ MD, yielded a trip gas of
1,545 units
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Colville 5301 44-12T awaits completion operations
to determine its ultimate production potential.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the
referenced well under NDAC 43-02..03-55. Oasis Petroleum North America LLC Intends to drill the sulface hole with
freshwater based drilling mud and set sulface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 6 days. The
casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43..02..03-21. No
saltwater will be used In the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the sulface casing Is
cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting
Into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TO will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to
complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of
drilling operations In accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43.02..03·55 of the NDAC, Is being requested to
take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an Initial rig that Is smaller than the rig necessary to
drill a well to total depth but Is not Intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation
under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis
Petroleum North America LLC understands NDAC 43-02..03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to
this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced Immediately after construction If the well pad Is located in a pasture (NDAC
43..02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis Petroleum North America LL will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the
well Is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
COLVILLE 5301 44-12T
SESE Section 12-153N-101W
McKenzie County
Well File # 25571
Dear Heather:
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 21551, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within the
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Section 13 & 24 T153N R101W.
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must take into
consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on
the above captioned location. Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) “No boiler, portable
electric lighting generator, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil
tank.” Due to surficial water adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire location.
In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be provided
affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to accept burial on their property of the
cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite spacing/drilling unit. OASIS PETRO NO
AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction.
Drilling pit
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings
pit.”
Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing
point is: 450’ south. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the
well head is: 10570’ south.Heather McCowan

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.
Permit Fee & Notification
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the
Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a
message if after hours or on the weekend.
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.
Surface casing cement
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.
Logs
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to
digitallogs@nd.gov
Thank you for your cooperation.

DETAILS OF WORK 
Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests a waiver from the tubing/pkr requirement included in 
NDAC 43-02-03-21: Casing, tubing, and cementing requirements during the completion period immediately 
following the upcoming fracture stimulation. 
The following assurances apply: 
1. The well is equipped with new 29# & 32# casing at surface with an API burst rating of 11,220 psi 
2. The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.85 API burst rating to determine the maximum pressure. 
3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment. 
4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flow back than during the frac job. 
5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates. 
6. Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing. 
7. A 300# gauge will be installed on the surface casing during the flowback period.

INTRODUCTION  
 
Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Colville 5301 44-12T [SE SE Sec. 12-T153N-R101W] is 
located approximately 3 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The 
Colville 5301 44-12T is a horizontal Three Forks development well in part of Oasis Petroleum’s 
Camp prospect within the Williston Basin. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to 
approximately 10,333’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the Three 
Forks. This well is a two section lateral which originates in the southeast quarter of section 12, 
then drilled south across section 13, to the southeast quarter of section 24 (Figure 2). Directional 
drilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the upper Three Forks 
reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock. 
 
OFFSET WELLS  
 
The primary offset wells used for depth correlation during curve operations were the Gulf Oil 
Exploration and Production, Lindvig 1-11-3C; and the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC 
Ash Federal 5300 11-18T. The Gulf Oil Exploration and Production, Lindvig 1-11-3C [SE SE 
Sec. 11, T153N, R101W] is located approximately ½ of a mile west of the Colville 5301 44-12T. 
This well was completed in March of 1982 reached a total depth of 13,800’ true vertical depth 
(TVD). The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Ash Federal 5300 11-18T [Lot 1 Section 18, 
T153N, R100W] is located approximately east north east of the Colville 5301 44-12T. This well 
was drilled to the Three Forks landing of 10,794’ MD in August and September of 2012. The 
formation thicknesses expressed by gamma signatures in these wells, and the Oasis Petroleum 
North America, LLC Larry 5301 44-12B [SE NE Section 12, T153N, R101W] were used to 
assist in landing the curve. This was accomplished by comparing gamma signatures from the 
offset wells to gamma data collected during drilling operations. The casing target landing was 
periodically updated to ensure accurate landing of the curve. Data used in this evaluation are 
included as an appendix to this report.

GEOLOGY  
 
Lithology 
 
The Ratcliffe interval [Charles Formation] was drilled at 9,228' MD 9,227' TVD (-7,142') SS. 
The top of this interval was observed as faster penetration rates were encountered, as the well 
bore transitioned from anhydrite to limestone. This limestone was tan to gray tan, light brown 
gray, occasional light brown, rare off white lime mudstone. This facies was microcrystalline, 
firm, with an earthy to crystalline texture, as well as contained traces of disseminated pyrite. 
Also noted in certain areas was a trace light brown oil stain; possible earthy to intercrystalline 
porosity may have been present 
 
The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 9,420' MD 9,419' 
TVD (-7,334') SS. The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of lime mudstone that was 
described as light brown, light gray brown to brown, occasional cream, rare light gray, trace off 
white to white in color.  The Mission Canyon was predominately friable to firm, dense with an 
earthy to crystalline texture. Some intervals were trace siliceous with traces of disseminated 
pyrite. Fossil fragments, along with black, dark brown algal laminations and a trace of stylolites 
were visible in some samples throughout the Mission Canyon Formation. Following connections 
or periods of non-circulation, gas shows of 39 to 46 units were noted and a trace to rare spotty 
light to medium brown spotty oil stain was occasionally observed while logging the Mission 
Canyon Formation.

The Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,762' MD 
10,699' TVD (-8,614') SS. Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated 
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black carbonaceous and petroliferous 
shale was sub blocky and firm with an earthy texture.  Trace minerals were observed to include 
disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill. Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a 
maximum of 305 units. 
 
The Bakken Middle Member [Mississippian-Devonian] was reached at 10,792' MD 10,715' TVD 
(-8,630') SS. This formation was predominantly siltstone and silty sandstone noted by the 
decreasing penetration rates, gamma API counts, and recorded gas levels, relative to the 
overlying source rock. The siltstone was light gray, sub-platy to sub-blocky, with an earthy 
texture. It was moderately calcite cemented, with traces of disseminated pyrite. Also present was 
silty sandstone which was light gray, light gray tan, rare buff, firm, very fine grained, well 
sorted, friable, sub-angular to sub-round, and contained possible intergranular porosity. It was 
moderately calcite cemented. Trace minerals included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Drilling 
gas in this interval reached a maximum of 145 units, with a connection gas of 256 units. Also 
observed was spotty light brown spotty oil stain.  
 
                                       
 
 
Figure 4. Sample from the Lower Bakken Shale Member 
 
The Lower Bakken Shale Member [Devonian] was reached at 10,878' MD 10,758' TVD (-8,673') 
SS. This was 19’ low to the Lindvig 1-11-3C. Entry into this interval was characterized by high 
gamma, elevated background gas and increased rates of penetration. The carbonaceous black, 
black gray shale is petroliferous, with a blocky texture and exhibits possible fracture porosity. 
Trace minerals included disseminated pyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 
312 units with a connection gas of 311 units. 
 
The Pronghorn Member [Devonian-Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,906' MD 10,769' TVD 
(-8,684') SS. Entry into this interval was characterized by lower gamma, and slightly slower 
penetration rates. Samples from the Pronghorn were described as siltstone which was medium to 
dark gray, gray brown, friable, sub-platy to sub-blocky, with an earthy texture. This siltstone was 
moderately dolomite cemented and included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Drilling gas in this 
interval reached a maximum of 196 units with a connection gas of 278 units. 
 
The Three Forks Formation [Devonian] was reached at 10,949' MD 10,783 TVD (-8,698') SS. 
The target zone of the Three Forks was to be drilled in a predominatly dolomite eight foot zone 
beginning 16 feet into the Three Forks Formation.  
 
  
 
 
Figure 5 & 6.  Sample of the predominately dolomitic facies in the preferred drilling zone of the Three Forks 
formation on left; sample from a brief contact with underlying claystone on the right.  
  
Samples in the Three Forks were commonly dolomite which is tan, cream, occasional light 
brown, rare light gray tan, trace light gray. Additionally this facies was friable and dense with an 
earthy texture. It also contained a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Possible 
intercrystalline porosity was observed, as was a rare to a trace of light brown spotty oil stain. 
Present in varying amounts was light gray to off white, rare light green shale which was friable 
to firm, sub-blocky with an earthy texture. Trace of nodular and disseminated pyrite was noted in  
the shale which contained no visible porosity. 
 
Gas Show  
 
Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during 
the drilling of the Yukon 5301 41-12T. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples were 
continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained near 
balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas on the Colville 
5301 44-12T varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which may have 
reflected increased porosity. Background concentrations ranged from 300 to 600 units, and 
connection peaks of 1,000 to 1,200 units were observed in the middle of the target zone. A trip at 
19,527’ MD, yielded a trip gas of 1,545 units. Chromatography of gas revealed typical 
concentrations of methane, ethane, propane and butane characteristic of Bakken and Three Forks 
gas (Figure 7).

Geo-steering 
 
Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling 
(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers MWD and Sunburst Consulting personnel 
worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to 
maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of 
the formation.  
 
The 873’ curve was drilled in 24 hours with bit #2 a Security FXD55D, attached to a 2.38 degree 
fixed NOV 7/8 5 stage mud motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed at 
11,173’ MD, approximately 25’ into the Three Forks Formation. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-
110 casing was set to 11,144’ MD.  
 
Geologic structure maps of the Colville 5301 44-12T and surrounding control wells, estimated 
formational dip to move down at approximately -0.3º initially, then reverse due to a plunging 
syncline at about 2,500’, reversing to an estimated 0.5º  to 1.0º  until total depth (TD) was 
reached.  The Colville 5301 44-12T preferred drilling interval consisted of an eight foot zone 
located approximately sixteen feet into the Three Forks Formation. Stratigraphic position in the 
target zone was based on penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data and sample observations. 
The projected target landing was to be sixteen feet into the Three Forks and was successfully 
reached prior to casing operations. Using offsets provided by Oasis representatives, projected 
porosity zones were identified as the preferred drilling areas (Figure 9).  
 
 
 
 
Figure 9.  Type log gamma profile from the Lindvig 1-11-3C, with target points.  
 
Steering decisions were made by using the higher gamma, of the underlying claystone, the low 
gamma located in the middle to higher portion of the drilling zone, and the fluctuating high to 
medium gamma located at the top of the drilling zone.  
 
The TD of 21,090’ MD was achieved at 1720 hours CDT on August 12, 2013. The well site team 
worked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 76% of the 
lateral, opening 10,141’ of potentially productive reservoir rock. The hole was then circulated 
and reamed for completion. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SUMMARY  
 
The Colville 5301 44-12T is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Three Forks 
development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD in 21 
days. The TD of 21,090’ MD was achieved at 1720 hours CDT August 12, 2013. The well site 
team worked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 76% of the 
lateral, opening 10,141’ of potentially productive reservoir rock. 
 
Diesel invert drilling fluid 9.5-10.1 ppg for the vertical hole and 10.15-10.4 ppg for curve 
operations were used to maintain stable hole conditions, minimize washout through the salt 
intervals and permit adequate analysis of mud gas concentrations.  
 
Samples in the Three Forks were commonly dolomite which is tan, cream, occasional light 
brown, rare light gray tan, trace light gray. Additionally this facies was friable and dense with an 
earthy texture. It also contained a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Possible 
intercrystalline porosity was observed, as was a rare to a trace of light brown spotty oil stain. 
Present in varying amounts was light gray to off white, rare light green shale which was friable 
to firm, sub-blocky with an earthy texture. Trace of nodular and disseminated pyrite was noted, 
and the shale contained no visible porosity. 
 
Gas on the Colville 5301 44-12T varied according to penetration rates and stratigraphic position 
of the well bore. Observed concentrations of background gas ranged from 300 to 600 units, and 
connection peaks of 1,000 to 1,200 units were observed in the middle portion of formation while 
drilling in the lateral where shows were the best. A trip at 19,527’ MD, yielded a trip gas of 
1,545 units 
 
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Colville 5301 44-12T awaits completion operations 
to determine its ultimate production potential.

LITHOLOGY 
 
Rig crews caught lagged samples, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, in 30’ intervals 
from 8,240’ to 10,940’, 10’ intervals from 10,940’ to 11,170’and then 30’ intervals from 11,170’ 
to the TD of 21,090’.  Sample or gamma ray marker tops have been inserted in the sample 
descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular 
microscope.

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the 
referenced well under NDAC 43-02..03-55. Oasis Petroleum North America LLC Intends to drill the sulface hole with 
freshwater based drilling mud and set sulface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 6 days. The 
casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43..02..03-21. No 
saltwater will be used In the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the sulface casing Is 
cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting 
Into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TO will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to 
complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of 
drilling operations In accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43.02..03·55 of the NDAC, Is being requested to 
take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an Initial rig that Is smaller than the rig necessary to 
drill a well to total depth but Is not Intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation 
under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis 
Petroleum North America LLC understands NDAC 43-02..03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to 
this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced Immediately after construction If the well pad Is located in a pasture (NDAC 
43..02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis Petroleum North America LL will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the 
well Is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

Well File # 25571 
 
Dear Heather: 
 
   Pursuant to Commission Order No. 21551, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The 
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than 
the 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Section 13 & 24 T153N R101W.  
 
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must take into 
consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on 
the above captioned location.  Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) “No boiler, portable 
electric lighting generator, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil 
tank.”  Due to surficial water adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire location.  
In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be provided 
affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to accept burial on their property of the 
cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite spacing/drilling unit.  OASIS PETRO NO 
AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction. 
 
Drilling pit 
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well 
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will 
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits 
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings 
pit.” 
 
Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines  
  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing 
point is: 450’ south.   Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the 
well head is: 10570’ south.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) 
   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the 
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to 
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may 
be waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information 
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other 
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the 
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit. 
 
Permit Fee & Notification 
   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested 
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the 
Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal 
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are 
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a 
message if after hours or on the weekend.  
 
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells 
   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor 
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys 
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may 
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the 
operation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe 
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve 
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. 
 
Surface casing cement 
 
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi 
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.   
 
Logs 
 
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and 
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and 
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation 
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log 
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to 
digitallogs@nd.gov 
   
Thank you for your cooperation.
