INTRODUCTION
Oasis Petroleum North America LLC. Larry 5301 44-12B [SE SE Sec. 12, T153N
R101W] is located approximately 8 miles south and 2 miles west of the town of Williston
in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Larry 5301 44-12B is a horizontal Middle
Bakken development well in part of Oasis Petroleum’s Baker prospect within the
Williston Basin. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to approximately 10,246’.
The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the Middle Bakken. This
well is a three section horizontal lateral which originates in the southeast quarter of
Section 12, then drilled south to land in northeast quarter of Section 13. The well bore
was steered south to the southeast of Section 25. (Figure 2) Directional drilling
technologies were used to land in the Middle Bakken Member reservoir and maintain
exposure to the target.PLAN VIEW

OFFSET WELLS
The primary offset wells used for depth correlation during curve operations were the Gulf
Oil Exploration and Production Lindvig 1-11-3C; and the Oasis Petroleum North
America, LLC. Bray 5301 43-12H. The Gulf Oil Exploration and Production Lindvig 1-
11-3C [SE SE Section 11, T153N, R101W] is located approximately 1 mile west of the
Larry 5301 44-12B. This well was completed in March of 1982 reached a total depth of
13,800, true vertical depth (TVD). The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Bray 5301
43-12H [SWSE Section 12 T153N, R101W] is located approximately 1/4 mile west of
the Larry 5301 44-12B. This well was completed in October of 2011 and reached a total
depth of 20,978’ MD. The formation thicknesses expressed by gamma signatures in these
wells, and the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Kline 5300 11-18H [Lot 1 Section
18, T153N, R100W] were used to assist in landing the curve. This was accomplished by
comparing gamma signatures from the offset wells to gamma data collected during
drilling operations. The casing target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was periodically
updated to ensure accurate landing of the curve. Data used in this evaluation are found in
this report.

ENGINEERING
Vertical Operations
The Larry 5301 44-12B was re-entered on 16 July, 2012 by Nabors B22. A 13 ½” hole
was previously drilled with fresh water to 2,047’ and isolated with 9 ⅝” J-55 casing and
cemented to surface. After re-entry, the drilling fluid was diesel invert with target weight
of 9.6-9.9 ppg for the vertical hole and 9.9-10.3 ppg for curve operations. The vertical
hole was drilled from surface casing to the KOP of 10,247’ MD in 94 hours with bit #1, a
Reed DSH616M , and a Baker 5/6 low speed motor.
Directional Operations
Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for MWD services in the
vertical hole, the curve, and throughout the lateral. The directional drillers (RPM), MWD
and Sunburst Consulting contractors worked closely together throughout the project to
evaluate data and make steering decisions to maximize the amount of borehole in the
targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of the formation.Curve Build
The curve was 843’ and was drilled in approximately 30 hours by bit #2, a 8 ¾” Reed
E1202-A1B PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree adjustable National 7/8 5 stage mud
motor. The curve was successfully landed at 11,090’ MD, approximately 15’ below the
base of the Upper Bakken Shale. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110 and 29# HCP-110
casing were set to 11,080’ MD and cemented.
Lateral
After completion of curve operations, MWD tools and bit #3, a 6” Baker DP505FX, 6
blade PDC bit, attached to a 1.5º fixed Baker XLP 5/6 high speed motor were run in the
hole. This assembly drilled to the TD of 21,140’ MD, drilling 10,050’ in 115 hours in the
lateral. Total depth of 21,140’, with a final azimuth of 182.60° and inclination of 89.40º
was achieved at 1550 hours CDT August 3, 2012. The resulting final vertical section was
10,723.80’.
The bottom hole location (BHL) is 10,516.82' south & 174.89' east of surface location or
approximately 253.46' FSL & 625.11' FEL, SE SE Sec. 24, T153N, R101W. The hole
was then circulated, and reamed for completion.
GEOLOGY
Methods
Geologic analysis for the Larry 5301 44-12B was provided by Sunburst Consulting, Inc.
Information was networked through Rig-watch’s electronic data recorder system. This
information network provided depth, drilling rate, pump strokes and total gas units to
multiple areas throughout the well site. Gas data was fed from Sunburst’s digital gas
detector, a total gas chromatograph, through Rig-watch for dissemination. Hydrocarbon
constituents (C through C ) were recorded in part-per-million concentrations. Gas
1 4
sampling was pulled through ¼” polyflo tubing after agitation in Sunburst’s gas trap at
the shakers. Rig crews caught lagged samples at the direction of the well site geologists.
Samples were collected at 30’ intervals in the vertical/curve and 30’ intervals in the
lateral. Rock cuttings were analyzed in wet and dry conditions under a 10x45 power
binocular microscope (for detailed lithologic descriptions see appendix). Cuttings were
sent to North Dakota Geologic Survey. In addition to rock samples, rate of penetration
and gamma ray data were also used in geologic analysis to aid geo-steering and dip
calculations.
Lithology
Formation analysis began at 8,170’ MD with a red orange siltstone and anhydrite
characteristic of the Kibbey Formation [Mississippian Big Snowy Group]. This interval
consisted of a sub-blocky to sub platy, red orange, friable to firm siltstone with
calcareous cement well to moderately cemented and an earthy texture. Also present was atrace amount of anhydrite which was off white. It was soft, amorphous, with an earthy
texture.
The Kibbey “Lime” came in at 8,348' MD (-6,265') subsea (SS). This marker is
represented by an anhydrite, which was off white. It was soft, amorphous, with an earthy
texture, and a trace of sand grains. The anhydrite is often accompanied by slower
penetration rates as the bit transitions out of the overlying siltstone. The rate of
penetration (ROP) then increases as the bit exits the anhydrite into the underlying
limestone mudstone. This carbonate was described as a light gray to gray lime mudstone
which was microcrystalline or occasionally laminated with an earthy texture. Samples in
the lower section consisted of red to red orange siltstone that was friable with an earthy
texture. This facies was moderately to well cemented with calcite and also was
interbedded with soft, off white amorphous or cryptocrystalline anhydrite.
The Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] consisted of salt, anhydrite,
limestone and argillaceous lime mudstone. The first Charles salt was drilled at 8,502' MD
(-6,419') SS. The Base of the Last Salt (BLS) was logged at 9,199' MD 9,198' TVD (-
7,115') SS as indicated by slower penetration rates and increased weight on bit. The
intervals of salt within the Charles Formation can be identified by an increase in
penetration rates and lower API gamma count rates. Samples of the salt intervals were
described as clear to milky, crystalline, euhedral to subhedral, and hard, with no visible
porosity. Slower penetration rates are observed as the bit encounters sections of limestone
mudstone to wackestone, which was light gray to light gray brown, light brown,
microcrystalline, friable, and dense, with an earthy texture. This limestone was
argillaceous in part in areas where gamma API counts were elevated. In areas where the
penetration rates were slowest anhydrite was observed. These samples were described as
off white to white, soft with cryptocrystalline texture or amorphous. Within the Charles
Formation at 9,086’ MD slower penetration rates indicated the presence of anhydrite.
This section was approximately 24’ thick, its base, as indicated by the transition to faster
penetration rates and higher gamma API counts is indicative of the Upper Berentson
which was drilled at 9,111' MD 9,110' TVD (-7,027') SS.
The Ratcliffe interval [Charles Formation] was drilled at 9,231' MD 9,230' TVD (-7,147')
SS. The top of this interval was observed as faster penetration rates were encountered, as
the well bore transitioned from anhydrite and limestone mudstone. This limestone was
light gray, medium gray, tan to medium brown mottled with a trace of cream. It was
microcrystalline, trace crystalline, friable to firm, and dense; with an earthy to crystalline
texture. A trace of intercrystalline porosity was noted along with a trace of dark brown
dead oil stain in some samples.
The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 9,420'
MD 9,419' TVD (-7,336') SS. The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of limestone and
argillaceous lime mudstone. This limestone facies was described as light gray, light
brown, light gray-brown, off white in color. The microcrystalline structure was
predominately friable to firm with an earthy to crystalline texture. Fossil fragments, along
with dark brown algal material were visible in some samples throughout the MissionCanyon Formation. A trace of spotty light brown oil stain was occasionally observed
while logging the Mission Canyon.
Figure 4. Limestone with spotty light brown & and dark brown dead oil staining
The Lodgepole Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was encountered at 9,979' MD
9,978' TVD (-7,895') SS. This interval was characterized by light to medium gray, light
gray-brown, traces of dark gray, with rare off white, argillaceous limestone mudstone
which was evidenced by the elevated gamma. The lithology was further characterized as
being microcrystalline, friable to firm, and dense, with an earthy to crystalline texture.
Disseminated pyrite was also seen in the samples as a trace mineral. Gas shows were
negligible in this formation.
The “False Bakken” was drilled at 10,797' MD 10,692' TVD (8,609') SS, and the Scallion
limestone at 10,799' MD 10,693’ TVD (-8,610’) SS. Samples from the False Bakken are
typically brown shale, friable, trace firm, sub-blocky, with an earthy texture. This facies
is calcareous, with a trace of disseminated pyrite. The Scallion lime mudstone, which was
off white to light brown, with light gray and a trace of dark gray. It was microcrystalline,
friable to firm, dense, with an earthy texture, along with a trace of disseminated pyrite.
Gas levels were elevated through this interval with a maximum of 2,640 units likely due
to fracture porosity.
The top of Upper Bakken Shale was drilled at 10,826' MD 10,703' TVD (8,620') which
was 11’ low to Bray 5301 43-12H. Entry into this interval was characterized by high
gamma, elevated background gas and increased rates of penetration. The shale is black,
sub-blocky to sub-platy, with an earthy texture. Additionally the shale is described as
carbonaceous and petroliferous. Trace minerals included disseminated pyrite. Drilling gas
in this interval reached a maximum of 1,209 units, with a sliding gas of 1,259 units.Figure 5. Sample of black, carbonaceous and petroliferous shale from the Upper Bakken Member.
The Bakken Middle Member was reached at 10,880' MD 10,718' TVD (-8,635') SS. This
formation was predominantly siltstone and silty sandstone noted by the decreasing
penetration rates, gamma API units, and recorded gas levels, relative to the overlying
source rock.
The target zone of the Middle Bakken was to be drilled in the silty sandstone facies in a
ten foot zone beginning 12 feet into the Middle Bakken Member.
Figure 6. Sample of sandstone and silty sandstone typical of the Middle Bakken target zone
Samples in the Middle Bakken were generally silty sandstone which was gray, off white
to white, tan, very fine grained silty sandstone consisting of moderately sorted,
subangular quartz grains. Additionally this facies was moderately calcite cemented; with
a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Poor intergranular porosity was observed, as
was a trace of light brown spotty oil stain. Also present in varying amounts was a light
brown to brown, translucent, with a trace of off white sandstone. This sandstone was fine
to very fine grained, friable, with sub-angular to sub-rounded quartz grains which were
moderately sorted, and calcite cemented. Also present was a trace of disseminated andnodular pyrite. It had from fair to poor intergranular porosity, with even and spotty light
brown oil stain.
Gas and Oil Shows
Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir
during the drilling of the Larry 5301 44-12B. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in
samples were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions
were maintained near balance. This allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be
monitored. Gas on the Larry 5301 44-12B varied according to penetration rates and
stratigraphic position. Observed concentrations ranged from 3,000 to 4,000 units
background gas, and connection peaks of 6,000 to 8,000 units in earlier portion of the
lateral where shows were the best. In the later portion of the lateral flow was diverted
through the gas buster, effectively muting recordable gas values. There were no trips
during the drilling of the lateral therefore no trip gases were observed. Chromatography
of gas revealed typical concentrations of methane, ethane, propane and butane (Figure 7).

Geo-steering
Geologic structure maps in the vicinity of the Larry 5301 44-12B estimated 0.15 to 0.2
degree down apparent dip for the first 4,000’ of the lateral. This apparent dip would then
reverse to a 0.38 degree up dip until total depth (TD) was reached. The Larry 5301 44-
12B preferred drilling interval consisted of a ten foot zone located approximately twelve
feet below the Upper Bakken Shale. Stratigraphic location in the target zone was based
on drill rates, gas shows, gamma ray values and sample observations. The projected
target landing was to be fourteen feet into the Middle Bakken and was successfully
reached prior to casing operations. Using offsets provided by Oasis representatives, a
projected porosity zones were identified as the preferred drilling areas.

latoTAs the well bore moved from the top to the bottom of the preferred drilling zone, gamma
API counts, collected samples, and gas were evaluated along with penetration rates to
identify areas within the 10’ preferred drilling zone that yielded the best penetration rates.
Offset logs identified by Oasis representatives indicated a porosity zones in the upper and
lower portion of the 10’ preferred drilling zone.
It should be noted that in the later portion of the lateral, after connections, the MWD tool,
would intermittently produce gamma API counts that were in excess of 200 API This
began at approximately 17,700’ MD until TD. Drilling would proceed with these values
until the API counts dropped to what were considered normal values, then the driller
would pick up and re-log the erroneous gamma ray data. These distances ranged from 10’
to 60’. The gamma API counts from approximately 17,700’ MD to TD, also appeared to
shift lower by approximately 10 to 15 API units, making it difficult to correlate with
gamma previously seen in the lateral.
Drilling out of intermediate casing the early inclinations were above 90 degrees. Offset
logs and information provided by Oasis representatives indicated that the well bore was
to follow a downward path during the early portion of the lateral, which led onsite
personnel to steer the well bore down to a position in the lower portion of the preferred
drilling zone, where it remained for the greater portion of the lateral. The assembly while
drilling in the lower portion of the target interval, began oscillating between two tight
streaks located above and below it. Gamma values that ranged from the mid forties to the
mid thirties, along with the presence of limestone in collected samples indicated that the
well bore had encountered the overlying limestone member. Gamma values in the mid
thirties to low forties indicated without the presence of limestone that the well bore had
encountered the hard streak below it, a well-cemented silty sandstone. Between these
tight streaks the gamma counts ranged form the mid forties to the mid sixties. As noted
earlier, from approximately 17,700’ MD to TD, these values shifted 10 to 15 API counts
lower.
As the well bore drilled to the south, the overlying limestone member appeared to thin,
until it was no longer logged with gamma or observed in drill cuttings. The well bore
then moved up to the upper portion of the preferred drilling zone, and even above it. The
well bore, while above the target interval persistent to rise on rotation, and continued to
deflect off of a tight streak located below it. It became necessary to institute many down
side slides to keep the well bore from striking the overlying upper Bakken shale.
Total depth (TD) of 20,464’ MD was reached at 1550 hours CDT August 3, 2012. The
well-site team worked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target
interval for 92% of the lateral, opening 9,812’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.

ammaGSUMMARY
The Larry 5301 44-12B is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle Bakken
development program. The project was drilled from surface to TD in 19 days. The TD of
21,140’ MD was achieved at 1550 hours CDT August 3, 2012. The well site team worked
well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 92% of the
lateral, opening 9,812’ of potentially productive reservoir rock
Diesel invert drilling fluid 9.6-9.9 ppg for the vertical hole and 9.9-10.3 ppg for curve
operations were used to maintain stable hole conditions, minimize washout through the salt
intervals and permit adequate analysis of mud gas concentrations.
Samples in the Middle Bakken were generally silty sandstone which was varying shades
of gray, off white to white, tan, very fine grained silty sandstone consisting of moderately
sorted, subangular quartz grains. Additionally this facies was moderately calcite
cemented; with a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Poor intergranular porosity
was observed, as was a trace of light brown spotty oil stain. Also present in varying
amounts was a light brown to brown, translucent, with a trace of off white sandstone.
This sandstone was fine to very fine grained, friable, with subangular to subround quartz
grains which were moderately sorted, and calcite cemented. Also present was a trace of

from 3,000 to 4,000 units background gas, and connection peaks of 6,000 to 8,000 units
in earlier portion of the lateral where shows were the best. In the later portion of the
lateral flow was diverted through the gas buster, effectively muting recordable gas values.
There were no trips during the drilling of the lateral therefore no trip gases were noted.

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Larry 5301 44-12B
Rig crews caught lagged samples, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, in 30’ intervals from 8,170’ to
10,870’, 10’ intervals from 10,870’ to 11,090’, and then 30’ intervals to the TD at 20,464’ MD. Sample or gamma
ray marker tops have been inserted in the sample descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined wet and
dry under a binocular microscope. The drilling fluid was diesel-based invert from surface casing to the TD of the
curve at 11,090’, and salt water from 11,090’ to 21,140’ MD.

RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
LARRY 5301 44-12B
SESE Section 12-153N-101W
McKenzie County
Well File # 22740
Dear Kaitlin:
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 18012, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is
granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 200' setback from the
north & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of
Sections 13 & 24 T153N, R101W.
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: DUE TO SURFICIAL WATER ADJACENT TO THE WELL SITE, A DIKE IS
REQUIRED SURROUNDING THE ENTIRE LOCATION. In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an
off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be provided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to
accept burial on their property of the cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite spacing/drilling
unit. Tool error is not required pursuant to order. OASIS PETRO. NO. AMER. must contact NDIC Field
Inspector Marc Binns at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction.
Drilling pit
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and
completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of
the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be
inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized
in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit.”
Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing point is: 450’
south. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinates from the well head are: 10570’
south and 300’ east.
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved
drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd
business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.
Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating
circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that would allow the Director to
conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.
Permit Fee & Notification
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that
notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas
Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00
p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.Kaitlin Bass

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a
certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be submitted as
one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be
filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner.
Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when
sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.
Surface casing cement
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail
cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or
initiating tests.
Logs
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of cement can be
determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma Ray Log must be run from
total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as one paper copy and one digital copy in
LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs,
Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files. To create a
solution and establish a standard format for industry to follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval
for the operator to submit an image log as a TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when
the log cannot be produced in its entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5”
floppy diskette, a standard CD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov
Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
Nathaniel Erbele

INTRODUCTION  
 
Oasis Petroleum North America LLC. Larry 5301 44-12B [SE SE Sec. 12, T153N 
R101W] is located approximately 8 miles south and 2 miles west of the town of Williston 
in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Larry 5301 44-12B is a horizontal Middle 
Bakken development well in part of Oasis Petroleum’s Baker prospect within the 
Williston Basin. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to approximately 10,246’. 
The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the Middle Bakken. This 
well is a three section horizontal lateral which originates in the southeast quarter of 
Section 12, then drilled south to land in northeast quarter of Section 13. The well bore 
was steered south to the southeast of Section 25. (Figure 2) Directional drilling 
technologies were used to land in the Middle Bakken Member reservoir and maintain 
exposure to the target.

OFFSET WELLS  
 
The primary offset wells used for depth correlation during curve operations were the Gulf 
Oil Exploration and Production Lindvig 1-11-3C; and the Oasis Petroleum North 
America, LLC. Bray 5301 43-12H. The Gulf Oil Exploration and Production Lindvig 1-
11-3C [SE SE Section 11, T153N, R101W] is located approximately 1 mile west of the 
Larry 5301 44-12B. This well was completed in March of 1982 reached a total depth of 
13,800, true vertical depth (TVD). The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Bray 5301 
43-12H [SWSE Section 12 T153N, R101W] is located approximately 1/4 mile west of 
the Larry 5301 44-12B. This well was completed in October of 2011 and reached a total 
depth of 20,978’ MD. The formation thicknesses expressed by gamma signatures in these 
wells, and the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Kline 5300 11-18H [Lot 1 Section 
18, T153N, R100W] were used to assist in landing the curve. This was accomplished by 
comparing gamma signatures from the offset wells to gamma data collected during 
drilling operations. The casing target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was periodically 
updated to ensure accurate landing of the curve. Data used in this evaluation are found in 
this report.

ENGINEERING  
 
Vertical Operations  
 
The Larry 5301 44-12B was re-entered on 16 July, 2012 by Nabors B22. A 13 ½” hole 
was previously drilled with fresh water to 2,047’ and isolated with 9 ⅝” J-55 casing and 
cemented to surface. After re-entry, the drilling fluid was diesel invert with target weight 
of 9.6-9.9 ppg for the vertical hole and 9.9-10.3 ppg for curve operations. The vertical 
hole was drilled from surface casing to the KOP of 10,247’ MD in 94 hours with bit #1, a 
Reed DSH616M , and a Baker 5/6 low speed motor. 
 
Directional Operations  
 
Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for MWD services in the 
vertical hole, the curve, and throughout the lateral. The directional drillers (RPM), MWD 
and Sunburst Consulting contractors worked closely together throughout the project to 
evaluate data and make steering decisions to maximize the amount of borehole in the 
targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of the formation.  
 
Curve Build  
 
The curve was 843’ and was drilled in approximately 30 hours by bit #2, a 8 ¾” Reed 
E1202-A1B PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree adjustable National 7/8 5 stage mud 
motor. The curve was successfully landed at 11,090’ MD, approximately 15’ below the 
base of the Upper Bakken Shale. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110 and 29# HCP-110 
casing were set to 11,080’ MD and cemented.  
 
Lateral  
 
After completion of curve operations, MWD tools and bit #3, a 6” Baker DP505FX, 6 
blade PDC bit, attached to a 1.5º fixed Baker XLP 5/6 high speed motor were run in the 
hole. This assembly drilled to the TD of 21,140’ MD, drilling 10,050’ in 115 hours in the 
lateral. Total depth of 21,140’, with a final azimuth of 182.60° and inclination of 89.40º 
was achieved at 1550 hours CDT August 3, 2012.  The resulting final vertical section was 
10,723.80’.  
 
The bottom hole location (BHL) is 10,516.82' south & 174.89' east of surface location or 
approximately 253.46' FSL & 625.11' FEL, SE SE Sec. 24, T153N, R101W. The hole 
was then circulated, and reamed for completion. 
 
GEOLOGY  
 
Methods  
 
Geologic analysis for the Larry 5301 44-12B was provided by Sunburst Consulting, Inc. 
Information was networked through Rig-watch’s electronic data recorder system. This 
information network provided depth, drilling rate, pump strokes and total gas units to 
multiple areas throughout the well site. Gas data was fed from Sunburst’s digital gas 
detector, a total gas chromatograph, through Rig-watch for dissemination. Hydrocarbon 
constituents (C1 through C4) were recorded in part-per-million concentrations. Gas 
sampling was pulled through ¼” polyflo tubing after agitation in Sunburst’s gas trap at 
the shakers. Rig crews caught lagged samples at the direction of the well site geologists. 
Samples were collected at 30’ intervals in the vertical/curve and 30’ intervals in the 
lateral. Rock cuttings were analyzed in wet and dry conditions under a 10x45 power 
binocular microscope (for detailed lithologic descriptions see appendix). Cuttings were 
sent to North Dakota Geologic Survey. In addition to rock samples, rate of penetration 
and gamma ray data were also used in geologic analysis to aid geo-steering and dip 
calculations.  
 
Lithology 
 
Formation analysis began at 8,170’ MD with a red orange siltstone and anhydrite 
characteristic of the Kibbey Formation [Mississippian Big Snowy Group]. This interval 
consisted of a sub-blocky to sub platy, red orange, friable to firm siltstone with 
calcareous cement well to moderately cemented and an earthy texture. Also present was a 
trace amount of anhydrite which was off white. It was soft, amorphous, with an earthy 
texture. 
 
The Kibbey “Lime” came in at 8,348' MD (-6,265') subsea (SS). This marker is 
represented by an anhydrite, which was off white. It was soft, amorphous, with an earthy 
texture, and a trace of sand grains. The anhydrite is often accompanied by slower 
penetration rates as the bit transitions out of the overlying siltstone. The rate of 
penetration (ROP) then increases as the bit exits the anhydrite into the underlying 
limestone mudstone. This carbonate was described as a light gray to gray lime mudstone 
which was microcrystalline or occasionally laminated with an earthy texture. Samples in 
the lower section consisted of red to red orange siltstone that was friable with an earthy 
texture. This facies was moderately to well cemented with calcite and also was 
interbedded with soft, off white amorphous or cryptocrystalline anhydrite.  
 
The Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] consisted of salt, anhydrite, 
limestone and argillaceous lime mudstone. The first Charles salt was drilled at 8,502' MD 
(-6,419') SS. The Base of the Last Salt (BLS) was logged at 9,199' MD 9,198' TVD (-
7,115') SS as indicated by slower penetration rates and increased weight on bit. The 
intervals of salt within the Charles Formation can be identified by an increase in 
penetration rates and lower API gamma count rates. Samples of the salt intervals were 
described as clear to milky, crystalline, euhedral to subhedral, and hard, with no visible 
porosity. Slower penetration rates are observed as the bit encounters sections of limestone 
mudstone to wackestone, which was light gray to light gray brown, light brown, 
microcrystalline, friable, and dense, with an earthy texture. This limestone was 
argillaceous in part in areas where gamma API counts were elevated. In areas where the 
penetration rates were slowest anhydrite was observed. These samples were described as 
off white to white, soft with cryptocrystalline texture or amorphous. Within the Charles 
Formation at 9,086’ MD slower penetration rates indicated the presence of anhydrite. 
This section was approximately 24’ thick, its base, as indicated by the transition to faster 
penetration rates and higher gamma API counts is indicative of the Upper Berentson 
which was drilled at 9,111' MD 9,110' TVD (-7,027') SS. 
 
The Ratcliffe interval [Charles Formation] was drilled at 9,231' MD 9,230' TVD (-7,147') 
SS. The top of this interval was observed as faster penetration rates were encountered, as 
the well bore transitioned from anhydrite and limestone mudstone. This limestone was 
light gray, medium gray, tan to medium brown mottled with a trace of cream. It was 
microcrystalline, trace crystalline, friable to firm, and dense; with an earthy to crystalline 
texture. A trace of intercrystalline porosity was noted along with a trace of dark brown 
dead oil stain in some samples. 
 
The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 9,420' 
MD 9,419' TVD (-7,336') SS. The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of limestone and  
argillaceous lime mudstone. This limestone facies was described as light gray, light 
brown, light gray-brown, off white in color. The microcrystalline structure was 
predominately friable to firm with an earthy to crystalline texture. Fossil fragments, along 
with dark brown algal material were visible in some samples throughout the Mission 
Canyon Formation. A trace of spotty light brown oil stain was occasionally observed 
while logging the Mission Canyon.

The Lodgepole Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was encountered at 9,979' MD 
9,978' TVD (-7,895') SS. This interval was characterized by light to medium gray, light 
gray-brown, traces of dark gray, with rare off white, argillaceous limestone mudstone 
which was evidenced by the elevated gamma. The lithology was further characterized as 
being microcrystalline, friable to firm, and dense, with an earthy to crystalline texture. 
Disseminated pyrite was also seen in the samples as a trace mineral. Gas shows were 
negligible in this formation.     
               
The “False Bakken” was drilled at 10,797' MD 10,692' TVD (8,609') SS, and the Scallion 
limestone at 10,799' MD 10,693’ TVD (-8,610’) SS. Samples from the False Bakken are 
typically brown shale, friable, trace firm, sub-blocky, with an earthy texture. This facies 
is calcareous, with a trace of disseminated pyrite. The Scallion lime mudstone, which was 
off white to light brown, with light gray and a trace of dark gray. It was microcrystalline, 
friable to firm, dense, with an earthy texture, along with a trace of disseminated pyrite. 
Gas levels were elevated through this interval with a maximum of 2,640 units likely due 
to fracture porosity.  
 
The top of Upper Bakken Shale was drilled at 10,826' MD 10,703' TVD (8,620') which 
was  11’ low to Bray 5301 43-12H. Entry into this interval was characterized by high 
gamma, elevated background gas and increased rates of penetration. The shale is black, 
sub-blocky to sub-platy, with an earthy texture. Additionally the shale is described as 
carbonaceous and petroliferous. Trace minerals included disseminated pyrite. Drilling gas 
in this interval reached a maximum of 1,209 units, with a sliding gas of 1,259 units.

The Bakken Middle Member was reached at 10,880' MD 10,718' TVD (-8,635') SS. This 
formation was predominantly siltstone and silty sandstone noted by the decreasing 
penetration rates, gamma API units, and recorded gas levels, relative to the overlying 
source rock.  
 
The target zone of the Middle Bakken was to be drilled in the silty sandstone facies in a 
ten foot zone beginning 12 feet into the Middle Bakken Member.  
 
 
                                
  
 
Figure 6.  Sample of sandstone and silty sandstone typical of the Middle Bakken target zone 
 
  
Samples in the Middle Bakken were generally silty sandstone which was gray, off white 
to white, tan, very fine grained silty sandstone consisting of moderately sorted, 
subangular quartz grains. Additionally this facies was moderately calcite cemented; with 
a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Poor intergranular porosity was observed, as 
was a trace of light brown spotty oil stain. Also present in varying amounts was a light 
brown to brown, translucent, with a trace of off white sandstone. This sandstone was fine 
to very fine grained, friable, with sub-angular to sub-rounded quartz grains which were 
moderately sorted, and calcite cemented. Also present was a trace of disseminated and 
nodular pyrite. It had from fair to poor intergranular porosity, with even and spotty light 
brown oil stain.  
 
Gas and Oil Shows  
 
Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir 
during the drilling of the Larry 5301 44-12B. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in 
samples were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions 
were maintained near balance. This allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be 
monitored. Gas on the Larry 5301 44-12B varied according to penetration rates and 
stratigraphic position. Observed concentrations ranged from 3,000 to 4,000 units 
background gas, and connection peaks of 6,000 to 8,000 units in earlier portion of the 
lateral where shows were the best. In the later portion of the lateral flow was diverted 
through the gas buster, effectively muting recordable gas values. There were no trips 
during the drilling of the lateral therefore no trip gases were observed. Chromatography 
of gas revealed typical concentrations of methane, ethane, propane and butane (Figure 7).

Geo-steering 
 
Geologic structure maps in the vicinity of the Larry 5301 44-12B estimated 0.15 to 0.2 
degree down apparent dip for the first 4,000’ of the lateral. This apparent dip would then 
reverse to a 0.38 degree up dip until total depth (TD) was reached. The Larry 5301 44-
12B preferred drilling interval consisted of a ten foot zone located approximately twelve 
feet below the Upper Bakken Shale. Stratigraphic location in the target zone was based 
on drill rates, gas shows, gamma ray values and sample observations. The projected 
target landing was to be fourteen feet into the Middle Bakken and was successfully 
reached prior to casing operations. Using offsets provided by Oasis representatives, a 
projected 
porosity 
zones 
were 
identified 
as 
the 
preferred 
drilling 
areas. 
 
 
Figure 9.  CND Type log gamma profile from the Lindvig 1-11-3C. 
            
As the well bore moved from the top to the bottom of the preferred drilling zone, gamma 
API counts, collected samples, and gas were evaluated along with penetration rates to 
identify areas within the 10’ preferred drilling zone that yielded the best penetration rates. 
Offset logs identified by Oasis representatives indicated a porosity zones in the upper and 
lower portion of the 10’ preferred drilling zone.  
 
It should be noted that in the later portion of the lateral, after connections, the MWD tool, 
would intermittently produce gamma API counts that were in excess of 200 API This 
began at approximately 17,700’ MD until TD. Drilling would proceed with these values 
until the API counts dropped to what were considered normal values, then the driller 
would pick up and re-log the erroneous gamma ray data. These distances ranged from 10’ 
to 60’. The gamma API counts from approximately 17,700’ MD to TD, also appeared to 
shift lower by approximately 10 to 15 API units, making it difficult to correlate with 
gamma previously seen in the lateral.  
 
Drilling out of intermediate casing the early inclinations were above 90 degrees. Offset 
logs and information provided by Oasis representatives indicated that the well bore was 
to follow a downward path during the early portion of the lateral, which led onsite 
personnel to steer the well bore down to a position in the lower portion of the preferred 
drilling zone, where it remained for the greater portion of the lateral. The assembly while 
drilling in the lower portion of the target interval, began oscillating between two tight 
streaks located above and below it. Gamma values that ranged from the mid forties to the 
mid thirties, along with the presence of limestone in collected samples indicated that the 
well bore had encountered the overlying limestone member. Gamma values in the mid 
thirties to low forties indicated without the presence of limestone that the well bore had 
encountered the hard streak below it, a well-cemented silty sandstone. Between these 
tight streaks the gamma counts ranged form the mid forties to the mid sixties. As noted 
earlier, from approximately 17,700’ MD to TD, these values shifted 10 to 15 API counts 
lower.  
 
As the well bore drilled to the south, the overlying limestone member appeared to thin, 
until it was no longer logged with gamma or observed in drill cuttings. The well bore 
then moved up to the upper portion of the preferred drilling zone, and even above it. The 
well bore, while above the target interval persistent to rise on rotation, and continued to 
deflect off of a tight streak located below it. It became necessary to institute many down 
side slides to keep the well bore from striking the overlying upper Bakken shale.  
 
Total depth (TD) of 20,464’ MD was reached at 1550 hours CDT August 3, 2012. The 
well-site team worked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target 
interval for 92% of the lateral, opening 9,812’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.

SUMMARY  
 
The Larry 5301 44-12B is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle Bakken 
development program. The project was drilled from surface to TD in 19 days. The TD of 
21,140’ MD was achieved at 1550 hours CDT August 3, 2012. The well site team worked 
well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 92% of the 
lateral, opening 9,812’ of potentially productive reservoir rock 
 
Diesel invert drilling fluid 9.6-9.9 ppg for the vertical hole and 9.9-10.3 ppg for curve 
operations were used to maintain stable hole conditions, minimize washout through the salt 
intervals and permit adequate analysis of mud gas concentrations.  
 
Samples in the Middle Bakken were generally silty sandstone which was varying shades 
of gray, off white to white, tan, very fine grained silty sandstone consisting of moderately 
sorted, subangular quartz grains. Additionally this facies was moderately calcite 
cemented; with a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Poor intergranular porosity 
was observed, as was a trace of light brown spotty oil stain. Also present in varying 
amounts was a light brown to brown, translucent, with a trace of off white sandstone. 
This sandstone was fine to very fine grained, friable, with subangular to subround quartz 
grains which were moderately sorted, and calcite cemented. Also present was a trace of 
disseminated and nodular pyrite. It had from fair to poor intergranular porosity, with even 
and spotty light brown oil stain.  
 
Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir 
during the drilling of the Larry 5301 44-12B. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in 
samples were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions 
were maintained near balance. This allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be 
monitored. Gas on the Larry 5301 44-12B varied according to penetration rates and 
location of the well bore in the stratigraphic column. Observed concentrations ranged 
from 3,000 to 4,000 units background gas, and connection peaks of 6,000 to 8,000 units 
in earlier portion of the lateral where shows were the best. In the later portion of the 
lateral flow was diverted through the gas buster, effectively muting recordable gas values. 
There were no trips during the drilling of the lateral therefore no trip gases were noted. 
 
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Larry 5301 44-12B awaits completion operations to 
determine its ultimate production potential.

LITHOLOGY  
 
Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Larry 5301 44-12B 
 
Rig crews caught lagged samples, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, in 30’ intervals from 8,170’ to 
10,870’, 10’ intervals from 10,870’ to 11,090’, and then 30’ intervals to the TD at 20,464’ MD. Sample or gamma 
ray marker tops have been inserted in the sample descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined wet and 
dry under a binocular microscope.  The drilling fluid was diesel-based invert from surface casing to the TD of the 
curve at 11,090’, and salt water from 11,090’ to 21,140’ MD.

Well File # 22740 
 
Dear Kaitlin: 
 
   Pursuant to Commission Order No. 18012, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is 
granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 200' setback from the 
north & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of 
Sections 13 & 24 T153N, R101W.  
 
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: DUE TO SURFICIAL WATER ADJACENT TO THE WELL SITE, A DIKE IS 
REQUIRED SURROUNDING THE ENTIRE LOCATION.  In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an 
off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be provided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to 
accept burial on their property of the cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite spacing/drilling 
unit.  Tool error is not required pursuant to order. OASIS PETRO. NO. AMER. must contact NDIC Field 
Inspector Marc Binns at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction.   
 
Drilling pit 
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and 
completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of 
the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be 
inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized 
in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit.” 
 
Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines  
  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  The 
proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing point is: 450’ 
south.   Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinates from the well head are: 10570’ 
south and 300’ east. 
 
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) 
   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved 
drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd 
business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.  
Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating 
circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that would allow the Director to 
conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit. 
 
Permit Fee & Notification 
   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested that 
notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas 
Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal location, permit number, 
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 
p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells 
   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a 
certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys must be submitted as 
one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be 
filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner.  
Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when 
sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. 
 
Surface casing cement 
 
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail 
cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or 
initiating tests.   
 
Logs 
 
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of cement can be 
determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma Ray Log must be run from 
total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore.  All logs must be submitted as one paper copy and one digital copy in 
LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director.  Image logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, 
Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files.  To create a 
solution and establish a standard format for industry to follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval 
for the operator to submit an image log as a TIFF (*.tif) formatted file.  The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when 
the log cannot be produced in its entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5” 
floppy diskette, a standard CD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov 
   
Thank you for your cooperation.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Sincerely,
