INTRODUCTION
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T [Lot 3 Section 18,
T153N, R100W] is located in Baker Field of the Williston Basin in western North Dakota. This
section lies approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston and adjacent to Lake
Sakakawea in McKenzie County. The Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T is a horizontal First Bench
Three Forks well, in a double-section, laydown spacing unit permitted to drill to the east from
the surface location within Section 18, continuing through Section 17 to the proposed bottom-
hole location (PBHL) in that section. There are 500’ setbacks along the north and south borders
and 200’ setbacks from the east and west borders within the 1,280 acre spacing unit. The well
consists of one Three Forks lateral. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to approximately
10,293’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the First Bench Three
Forks. Directional drilling technologies and geosteering techniques were used to land in the
Three Forks reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock. Oasis Petroleum is
targeting a dolomite and shale facies of the upper Three Forks Formation with intent to intersect
porosity and fracture trends enhancing reservoir quality.
OFFSET WELLS
Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the ‘Control
Data’ section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in providing control data,
making it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and landing target depth. Byreferencing the gamma signature of these offsets, a model was formed for the target interval
pinpointing a strategic landing. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in
these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in order to
successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was periodically
updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.
GEOLOGY
The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,393' MD 9,392'
TVD (-7,359' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was
described as light gray, light brown to brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime
mudstone was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rare crystalline texture. Some
intervals contained a trace of black-brown algal material, traces of fossil fragments, and traces of
disseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as light
gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The
argillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture.
Some intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. The highest gas shows were 71 to 115
units and 79 units of connection gas in the Mission Canyon. Rare intercrystalline porosity was
noted as well as trace spotty light brown oil stain while logging the Mission Canyon Formation.
The Upper Bakken Shale [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,727' MD 10,673'
TVD (-8,640' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray carbonaceous and
petroliferous shale was hard with a sub blocky to sub platy texture. Fracture porosity was noted,
and trace minerals were observed including disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill.
Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 2,881 units of drilling gas.
The Middle Bakken [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,756' MD
10,689' TVD (-8,656' SS) which was -2’ low to the Oasis Petroleum NA LLC Kline Federal
5300 31-18 15T. Samples in the Middle Bakken Member were predominantly silty sandstone
which was described as light gray brown, light brown, trace light gray in color. It was very fine
grained, friable, subrounded, smooth, moderately sorted, with calcite cement, moderately
cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was fair intergranular
porosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain. Hydrocarbons
evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 1,225 units of drilling gas.
The Lower Bakken Shale [Devonian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,836' MD 10,733' TVD
(-8,700' SS). Entry into this interval was characterized by high gamma, elevated background gas
and increased rates of penetration. The carbonaceous black, black gray shale is petroliferous,
hard, splintery, smooth and exhibits possible fracture porosity. Trace minerals included
disseminated pyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 1,160.
The Pronghorn Member [Devonian-Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,865' MD 10,746' TVD
(-8,713' SS). Entry into this interval was characterized by lower gamma, and slightly slower
penetration rates. Samples from the Pronghorn were described as siltstone which was dark gray
trace gray black, friable to firm, subblocky to subplaty. This siltstone was moderately dolomitecemented and included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Also noted was a trace of spotty light
brown oil stain. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 939 units.
The Three Forks [Devonian] was reached at 10,903' MD 10,760' TVD (-8,727' SS) which was -
6’ low to the Oasis Petroleum NA LLC Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T. The target zone of the
Three Forks was to be drilled in a predominately 14 foot zone beginning 12 feet into the Three
Forks.
Samples in the Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as light brown-
light brown gray, tan-cream, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a microsucrosic
texture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline porosity. Also
noted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was light green-light
gray green, mint green shale that was firm, subblocky, with an earthy texture. Occasional
disseminated pyrite was noted as was tight intergranular porosity.

target zone.
Hydrocarbon Shows
Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during
the drilling of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples
were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained
near balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas varied
according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which may have reflected increased
porosity. During the vertical, gas peaks of 41 to 135 units were noted, against a 9.4-10.5 lb/gal
diesel-invert mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 170to 5,036
units, against a 9.6-9.7 lb/gal saltwater gel drilling fluid. Chromatography of gas revealed typical
concentrations of methane, characteristic of First Bench Three Forks gas.Figure 4. Chromatography of a gas sample on the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T.

Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling
(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers, MWD, and Sunburst Consulting personnel
worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to
maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of
the formation.
The 870’ curve was drilled in 27 hours, circulating time. Two curve assemblies were used to
complete the curve. The first was a bottom hole assembly (BHA) consisting of bit #4; a Security
MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV stage 7/8 5.0 motor and MWD tools.
Due to insufficient builds, the decision was made to pull the assembly at 10,654’ and continue
the curve with a more severely bent motor and new bit. A new BHA was tripped in consisting of
bit #5; a Security MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.6 degree fixed NOV stage 7/8 5.0 motor
and MWD tools The curve was successfully landed at 11,090’ MD and 10,780’ TVD,
approximately 20’ into the Three Forks. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110 intermediate casing
was set to 11,063’ MD.
Geologic structure maps of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T and surrounding control wells had
estimated gross formation dip to be down at approximately -0.2º to the TD of the lateral. The
preferred drilling interval consisted of an 11’ zone of dolomite and shale and a 3’ zone of
claystone located approximately 11’ into the Three Forks. Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma
ray data, and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred
stratigraphic position in the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis representatives,
projected porosity zones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.
Figure 6. Offset well target definition, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).Steering decisions were made by using the low gamma in the lower portion of the target zone to
establish the well-bore’s position in the target zone. If the well-bore moved lower, the higher
gamma of the underlying claystone (G) was observed, as was the presence of claystone in
collected samples. Slides were then utilized to move the well-bore back up into the target zone.
As the well-bore moved higher, approaching the top of the target zone the high to medium
fluctuating gamma (D) was noted. Samples in the lower gamma portion of the target zone
contained noticeably greater concentrations of the light brown-light brown gray, tan-cream, trace
pink dolomite; as the well-bore moved higher in zone the samples tended to have more of the
light gray, off white, gray brown dolomite. This lateral was drilled in less than 4 days from
casing exit to TD, with one lateral assembly. The TD of 20,561’ MD was achieved at 14:20
hours CDT April 22, 2015. The wellbore was completed with 90% of the lateral in target,
opening 9,498’ (measurement taken from uncased lateral portion) of potentially productive
reservoir rock. The hole was then circulated and reamed for completion.
SUMMARY
The Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal First
Bench Three Forks development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface
casing to TD in 14 days. The TD of 20,561’ MD was achieved at 14:20 hours CDT April 22,
2015. The well site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval
for 90% of the lateral, opening 9,498’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.
Samples in the First Bench Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as
light brown-light brown gray, tan-cream, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a
microsucrosic texture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline
porosity. Also noted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was
light green-light gray green, mint green shale that was firm, subblocky, with an earthy texture.
Occasional disseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.
Gas on the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T varied according to stratigraphic position and
penetration rates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and hydrocarbon
shows were encouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Three Forks.
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T awaits completion
operations to determine its ultimate production potential.

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC
Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T
Rig crews caught 30’ sample intervals, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, from 8,240’, to the TD of the
lateral at 20,561’. Formation tops and lithologic markers have been inserted into the sample descriptions below
for reference. Sample descriptions begin in the Kibbey Formation just prior to the Kibbey Lime. Samples were
examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope. Sample fluorescent cuts are masked by invert mud through
intermediate casing. Quantifiers in order of increasing abundance are trace, rare, occasional, common and
abundant.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC requests a variance to rule 43-02-03-31 requiring electrical, radioactive or other
similar logs to be run to determine formation tops and zones of porosity. The surface location of this well will be
very near our Kline Federal 5300 11-18H (API #33-053-03426 NDIC # 20275) in Lot 1, Section 18, T153N, R100W and
the logs run on this well should be sufficient to determine formation tops in the vertical section of the well bore. As
outlined in our application for permit to drill, Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC will run gamma ray logs from KOP
to the total depth and cement bond log from the production casing total depth to surface. Two digital copies of all
mud logs (one tif and one las) will be submitted to the NDIC.

RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
KLINE FEDERAL 5300 31-18 7T2
LOT3 Section 18-153N-100W
McKenzie County
Well File # 28755
Dear Lauri:
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 17 & 18 T153N R100W.
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are
conducted. Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the
entire location. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-
770-3554 prior to location construction.
Drilling pit
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings
pit.”
Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10051’ east.
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.Lauri M. Stanfield
June 30, 2014

Permit Fee & Notification
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the
Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a
message if after hours or on the weekend.
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.
Surface casing cement
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.
Logs
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to
digitallogs@nd.gov
Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells
Dear Operator,
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
Bruce E. Hicks

INTRODUCTION  
 
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T [Lot 3 Section 18, 
T153N, R100W] is located in Baker Field of the Williston Basin in western North Dakota. This 
section lies approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston and adjacent to Lake 
Sakakawea in McKenzie County. The  Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T is a horizontal First Bench 
Three Forks well, in a double-section, laydown spacing unit permitted to drill to the east  from 
the surface location within Section 18, continuing through Section 17 to the proposed bottom-
hole location (PBHL) in that section. There are 500’ setbacks along the north and south borders 
and 200’ setbacks from the east and west borders within the 1,280 acre spacing unit. The well 
consists of one Three Forks lateral. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to approximately 
10,293’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the First Bench Three 
Forks. Directional drilling technologies and geosteering techniques were used to land in the 
Three Forks reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.  Oasis Petroleum is 
targeting a dolomite and shale facies of the upper Three Forks Formation with intent to intersect 
porosity and fracture trends enhancing reservoir quality. 
 
OFFSET WELLS  
 
Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the ‘Control 
Data’ section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in providing control data, 
making it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and landing target depth. By 
referencing the gamma signature of these offsets, a model was formed for the target interval 
pinpointing a strategic landing.  Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in 
these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in order to 
successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was periodically 
updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.  
 
GEOLOGY 
 
The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,393' MD 9,392' 
TVD (-7,359' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was 
described as light gray, light brown to brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime 
mudstone was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rare crystalline texture. Some 
intervals contained a trace of black-brown algal material, traces of fossil fragments, and traces of 
disseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as light 
gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The 
argillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture. 
Some intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. The highest gas shows were 71 to 115 
units and 79 units of connection gas in the Mission Canyon. Rare intercrystalline porosity was 
noted as well as trace spotty light brown oil stain while logging the Mission Canyon Formation. 
                              
The Upper Bakken Shale [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,727' MD 10,673' 
TVD (-8,640' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated 
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray carbonaceous and 
petroliferous shale was hard with a sub blocky to sub platy texture. Fracture porosity was noted, 
and trace minerals were observed including disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill. 
Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 2,881 units of drilling gas. 
                                                                               
The Middle Bakken [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,756' MD 
10,689' TVD (-8,656' SS) which was -2’ low to the Oasis Petroleum NA LLC Kline Federal 
5300 31-18 15T. Samples in the Middle Bakken Member were predominantly silty sandstone 
which was described as light gray brown, light brown, trace light gray in color. It was very fine 
grained, friable, subrounded, smooth, moderately sorted, with calcite cement, moderately 
cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was fair intergranular 
porosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain. Hydrocarbons 
evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 1,225 units of drilling gas. 
 
The Lower Bakken Shale [Devonian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,836' MD 10,733' TVD 
(-8,700' SS). Entry into this interval was characterized by high gamma, elevated background gas 
and increased rates of penetration. The carbonaceous black, black gray shale is petroliferous, 
hard, splintery, smooth and exhibits possible fracture porosity. Trace minerals included 
disseminated pyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 1,160. 
 
The Pronghorn Member [Devonian-Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,865' MD 10,746' TVD 
(-8,713' SS). Entry into this interval was characterized by lower gamma, and slightly slower 
penetration rates. Samples from the Pronghorn were described as siltstone which was dark gray 
trace gray black, friable to firm, subblocky to subplaty. This siltstone was moderately dolomite 
cemented and included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Also noted was a trace of spotty light 
brown oil stain. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 939 units. 
 
The Three Forks [Devonian] was reached at 10,903' MD 10,760' TVD (-8,727' SS) which was -
6’ low to the Oasis Petroleum NA LLC Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T. The target zone of the 
Three Forks was to be drilled in a predominately 14 foot zone beginning 12 feet into the Three 
Forks. 
 
Samples in the Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as light brown-
light brown gray, tan-cream, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a microsucrosic 
texture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline porosity. Also 
noted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was light green-light 
gray green, mint green shale that was firm, subblocky, with an earthy texture. Occasional 
disseminated pyrite was noted as was tight intergranular porosity.

target zone. 
 
Hydrocarbon Shows  
 
Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during 
the drilling of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples 
were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained 
near balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas varied 
according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which may have reflected increased 
porosity. During the vertical, gas peaks of 41 to 135 units were noted, against a 9.4-10.5 lb/gal 
diesel-invert mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 170to 5,036 
units, against a 9.6-9.7 lb/gal saltwater gel drilling fluid. Chromatography of gas revealed typical 
concentrations of methane, characteristic of First Bench Three Forks gas.

Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling 
(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers, MWD, and Sunburst Consulting personnel 
worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to 
maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of 
the formation.  
 
The 870’ curve was drilled in 27 hours, circulating time. Two curve assemblies were used to 
complete the curve. The first was a bottom hole assembly (BHA) consisting of bit #4; a Security 
MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV stage 7/8 5.0 motor and MWD tools. 
Due to insufficient builds, the decision was made to pull the assembly at 10,654’ and continue 
the curve with a more severely bent motor and new bit. A new BHA was tripped in consisting of 
bit #5; a Security MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.6 degree fixed NOV stage 7/8 5.0 motor 
and MWD tools The curve was successfully landed at 11,090’ MD and 10,780’ TVD, 
approximately 20’ into the Three Forks. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110 intermediate casing 
was set to 11,063’ MD.  
 
Geologic structure maps of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T and surrounding control wells had 
estimated gross formation dip to be down at approximately -0.2º to the TD of the lateral. The 
preferred drilling interval consisted of an 11’ zone of dolomite and shale and a 3’ zone of 
claystone located approximately 11’ into the Three Forks. Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma 
ray data, and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred 
stratigraphic position in the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis representatives, 
projected porosity zones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.  
 
 
 
Figure 6. Offset well target definition, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).   
 
Steering decisions were made by using the low gamma in the lower portion of the target zone to 
establish the well-bore’s position in the target zone. If the well-bore moved lower, the higher 
gamma of the underlying claystone (G) was observed, as was the presence of claystone in 
collected samples. Slides were then utilized to move the well-bore back up into the target zone. 
As the well-bore moved higher, approaching the top of the target zone the high to medium 
fluctuating gamma (D) was noted. Samples in the lower gamma portion of the target zone 
contained noticeably greater concentrations of the light brown-light brown gray, tan-cream, trace 
pink dolomite; as the well-bore moved higher in zone the samples tended to have more of the 
light gray, off white, gray brown dolomite. This lateral was drilled in less than 4 days from 
casing exit to TD, with one lateral assembly. The TD of 20,561’ MD was achieved at 14:20 
hours CDT April 22, 2015. The wellbore was completed with 90% of the lateral in target, 
opening 9,498’ (measurement taken from uncased lateral portion) of potentially productive 
reservoir rock. The hole was then circulated and reamed for completion. 
 
SUMMARY  
 
The Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal First 
Bench Three Forks development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface 
casing to TD in 14 days. The TD of 20,561’ MD was achieved at 14:20 hours CDT April 22, 
2015. The well site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval 
for 90% of the lateral, opening 9,498’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.  
 
Samples in the First Bench Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as 
light brown-light brown gray, tan-cream, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a 
microsucrosic texture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline 
porosity. Also noted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was 
light green-light gray green, mint green shale that was firm, subblocky, with an earthy texture. 
Occasional disseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.      
 
Gas on the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T varied according to stratigraphic position and 
penetration rates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and hydrocarbon 
shows were encouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Three Forks. 
 
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T awaits completion 
operations to determine its ultimate production potential.

LITHOLOGY 
Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC 
Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T 
Rig crews caught 30’ sample intervals, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, from 8,240’, to the TD of the 
lateral at 20,561’. Formation tops and lithologic markers have been inserted into the sample descriptions below 
for reference.  Sample descriptions begin in the Kibbey Formation just prior to the Kibbey Lime.  Samples were 
examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope. Sample fluorescent cuts are masked by invert mud through 
intermediate casing. Quantifiers in order of increasing abundance are trace, rare, occasional, common and 
abundant.

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC requests a variance to rule 43-02-03-31 requiring electrical, radioactive or other 
similar logs to be run to determine formation tops and zones of porosity. The surface location of this well will be 
very near our Kline Federal 5300 11-18H (API #33-053-03426 NDIC # 20275) in Lot 1, Section 18, T153N, R100W and 
the logs run on this well should be sufficient to determine formation tops in the vertical section of the well bore. As 
outlined in our application for permit to drill, Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC will run gamma ray logs from KOP 
to the total depth and cement bond log from the production casing total depth to surface. Two digital copies of all 
mud logs (one tif and one las) will be submitted to the NDIC.

Well File # 28755 
 
Dear Lauri: 
 
   Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The 
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than 
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 17 & 18 T153N R100W.  
 
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for 
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must 
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are 
conducted. Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the 
entire location.  OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-
770-3554 prior to location construction. 
 
Drilling pit 
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well 
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will 
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits 
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings 
pit.” 
 
Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines  
  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum 
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10051’ east. 
 
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) 
   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the 
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to 
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may 
be waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information 
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other 
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the 
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification 
   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested 
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the 
Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal 
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are 
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a 
message if after hours or on the weekend.  
 
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells 
   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor 
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys 
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may 
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the 
operation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe 
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve 
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. 
 
Surface casing cement 
 
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi 
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.   
 
Logs 
 
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and 
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and 
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation 
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log 
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to 
digitallogs@nd.gov

RE:  Filter Socks and Other Filter Media 
 
 
 
 
Leakproof Container Required 
 
 
 
 
Oil and Gas Wells 
 
Dear Operator, 
 
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with 
exploration or production of oil and  gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all 
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations. 
 
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota.  The Commission is very 
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. 
 
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the 
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations 
are conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an 
authorized facility.  Such containers must be: 
 
leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container 
 
covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container 
 
placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container 
 
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but 
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. 
 
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production 
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste 
Management.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the 
solid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, 
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  
 
Thank you for your cooperation.  
 
 
 
Sincerely,
