circulated 14 bbls of cement to surface.
o 7" shoe to DV tool is isolated with 15.8 tail cement.
• Second Stage pumped 40 bbls spacer, 42 bbls scavenger cement, 69 bbls 12.1 ppg lead,
and 70 bbls 15. 8 ppg tail (planned for 140 bbls ).
• While pumping Second Stage, operator notices saltwater valve was leaking into tail
slurry and soon after cement truck packed off.
• Attempted to circulate out cement with rig pumps, pumping 30 bbl fresh water followed
by 368 bbls invert.
• Pumps pressured up while circulating after getting 5 bbls of spacer to surface.

Richard,
Here are some notes of the operations on the Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B:
• After landing the bomb on the DV tool, we circulated out 14bbls of cement to surface from the first stage {7"
shoe to DV tool)
• When drilling out of the shoe, there was cement in the curve that needed to be milled up. Good cement at the
shoe
• After being notified of need to test DV tool after drilling through it, we ran bridge plug below the DV and tested
to 1515psi for 30min - good test
• We cemented the liner. Bumped plug, floats held. lObbls of cement circulated to surface after stinging out of
liner top.
We are proposing to frac down the 7" casing as originally planned. Please inform Oasis of any need to frac down a
tieback string or perform any sort of remediation prior to commencing frac operations.
Thanks,
Mike Brown

INTRODUCTION
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B [Lot 2 Section 19,
T153N, R100W] is located approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston in McKenzie
County, North Dakota. The Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B is a horizontal Middle Bakken well within
the Williston Basin consisting of one 9,369' (uncased) lateral drilled toward the east. The vertical
hole was planned to be drilled to approximately 10,230’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees
per 100’ to land within the Middle Bakken. This well is a two section lateral which originates in
the northwest quarter of section 19, then drilled east to the northeast quarter of section 20.
Directional drilling technologies and geosteering techniques were used to land in the Middle
Bakken reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.OFFSET WELLS
Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the ‘Control
Data’ section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in curve operations, to
successfully land within the Middle Bakken. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray
signatures in these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in
order to successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was
periodically updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.
GEOLOGY
The Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 8,535' MD 8,535' TVD
(-6,459' SS). Samples in the lower portion of the Charles Formation consisted of a limestone
mudstone, which was light brown, light gray brown, light gray brown, off white in color. It was
microcrystalline, friable, laminated, with an earthy texture. A trace of intercrystalline porosity
was observed as was occasional to rare spotty light brown oil stain. Occasionally noted was a
dolomite mudstone, which was light brown, light gray, light gray brown in color. It was
microcrystalline, friable-firm, laminated, with an earthy texture. Also noted was a trace of
intercrystalline porosity, and occasional spotty light brown oil stain. Rarely noted was anhydrite,
which was off white, cream in color. It was soft, microcrystalline, and massive with an earthy to
amorphous texture. Following connections or periods of non-circulation, gas peaks of 40 to 42
units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 31 to 40 units.
The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,435' MD 9,435'
TVD (-7,359' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was
described as light gray, light brown to brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime
mudstone was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rarely crystalline in texture. Some
intervals contained a trace of black-brown algal material, a trace of fossil fragments, and traces
of disseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as
light gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The
argillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture.
Some intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. Gas shows of 33 to 64 units were
present. Rare intercrystalline porosity was noted as well as traces to occasional spotty light
brown oil stain was occasionally observed while logging the Mission Canyon Formation.
The Upper Bakken Shale [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,888' MD 10,727'
TVD (-8,651' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray carbonaceous and
petroliferous shale was hard with a sub blocky to sub platy texture. Fracture porosity was noted,
and trace minerals were observed to include disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill.
Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 2,365 units drilling gas, with a
connection gas of 2,803 units.Figure 2. Black carbonaceous and petroliferous shale from the Upper Bakken Shale.
The Middle Bakken [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,958' MD
10,743' TVD (-8,667' SS) which was 4’ low to the Oasis Petroleum NA LLC Chalmers 5300 21-
19 8T. The target zone of the Middle Bakken was to be drilled in a predominately ten foot zone
beginning ten feet below the Upper Bakken Shale.
Samples in the Middle Bakken were predominantly silty sandstone which was described as light-
medium brown, occasional light gray brown, rare light gray in color. It was very fine grained,
firm-friable, sub rounded to sub angular, smooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement moderately
cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was occasional intergranular
porosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain.
Figure 3. Predominately silty sandstone sample from the Middle Bakken target zone.
Hydrocarbon Shows
Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during
the drilling of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples
were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained
near balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas on the
Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which
may have reflected increased porosity. During the vertical, gas peaks of 35 to 64 units werenoted, against a 10.1-11.4 lb/gal diesel-invert mud
weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged
from 1,000 to 5,100 units, against a 9.65-10.2 lb/gal
saltwater gel drilling fluid. Connection peaks of 2,000 to
4,500 units were observed, as were drilling gas shows of
2,500 units to 5,736 units coinciding with the best
shows. Drilling out of casing at 11,127’ MD yielded a
trip gas of 4,875 units. At 12,600’ the gas buster was
turned on, resulting in 5’-10’ intermittent flare and a
20’-25’ large bright orange trip flair at 14,878’.
Chromatography of gas revealed typical concentrations
of methane, characteristic of Middle Bakken Member
gas.

Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling
(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers and MWD, and Sunburst Consulting personnel
worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to
maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of
the formation.
The 904’ curve was drilled in 24 hours. It was drilled with a bottom hole assembly (BHA)
consisting of bit #3, a Security MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV stage
7/8 5.0 motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed at 11,127’ MD and 10,758’
TVD, approximately 15’ into the Middle Bakken. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110 casing was
set to 11,071’ MD.
Geologic structure maps of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B and surrounding control wells had
estimated formation dip to be a down dip at approximately 0.5º down to the TD of the lateral.
The preferred drilling interval of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B consisted of a ten foot zone
located approximately ten feet into the Middle Bakken. Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray
data, and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred stratigraphic
position in the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis representatives, projected
porosity zones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.
Figure 6. Offset well target definition, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).
Steering decisions were made by using gamma markers identified by Oasis representatives. The
high gamma (C) in the upper portion of the drilling zone was useful in identifying the well bore
placement in formation. The slightly lower gamma (B) was observed as the well bore moved to
the top of the target zone, followed by lower gamma as the well bore moved higher, out of the
target zone. Low gamma in the middle of the target zone (D) was noted as the well bore moved
to the middle of the target zone. As the well bore moved lower in formation, the higher gamma
(E) was noted as was lower gamma as the well bore moved lower in formation, exiting the target
zone. Samples collected when drilling below the target zone tended to have a greater
concentration of the light gray to gray silty sandstone than did the samples collected when the
well bore was higher in the target zone. The TD of 20,440’ MD was achieved at 16:40 hoursCST February 26, 2015. The well site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the
desired target interval for 77% of the lateral, opening 9,369’ of potentially productive reservoir
rock. The hole was then circulated and reamed for completion.
SUMMARY
The Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle
Bakken development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD
in 20 days. The TD of 20,440’ MD was achieved at 16:40 hours CST February 26, 2015. The
well site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval for 77% of
the lateral, opening 9,369’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.
Samples in the Middle Bakken were predominantly silty sandstone which was described as light-
medium brown, occasional light gray brown, rare light gray in color. It was very fine grained,
firm-friable, sub rounded to sub angular, smooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement moderately
cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was occasional intergranular
porosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain.
Gas on the Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration
rates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and hydrocarbon shows were
encouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Middle Bakken.
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B awaits completion
operations to determine its ultimate production potential.

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC
Chalmers 5300 21-19 11B
Rig crews caught 30’ sample intervals, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, from 8,240’ to the
TD of the lateral at 20,440’. Formation tops and lithologic markers have been inserted into the sample
descriptions below for reference. Sample descriptions begin in the Kibbey Formation just prior to the
Kibbey Lime. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope. Sample fluorescent
cuts are masked by invert mud through intermediate casing. Quantifiers in order of increasing abundance
are trace, rare, occasional, common and abundant.

RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
CHALMERS 5300 21-19 9T2
LOT2 Section 19-153N-100W
McKenzie County
Well File # 28648
Dear Brandi:
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 19 &20 T153N R100W.
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required
surrounding the entire location. Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are
conducted. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-7703-
554 prior to location construction.
Drilling pit
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings
pit.”
Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum
legal coordinate from the well head is: 9963’ east.
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.Brandi Terry
June 17, 2014

Permit Fee & Notification
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.
Surface casing cement
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.
Logs
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to
digitallogs@nd.gov
Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
Nathaniel Erbele

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells
Dear Operator,
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
Bruce E. Hicks

Suggs, Richard A. 
Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B cement 
Here are some notes of the operations on the Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B: 
• 
After landing the bomb on the DV tool, we circulated out 14bbls of cement to surface from the first stage {7" 
shoe to DV tool) 
• 
When drilling out of the shoe, there was cement in the curve that needed to be milled up. Good cement at the 
shoe 
• 
After being notified of need to test DV tool after drilling through it, we ran bridge plug below the DV and tested 
to 1515psi for 30min - good test 
• 
We cemented the liner. Bumped plug, floats held. lObbls of cement circulated to surface after stinging out of 
liner top. 
We are proposing to frac down the 7" casing as originally planned. Please inform Oasis of any need to frac down a 
tieback string or perform any sort of remediation prior to commencing frac operations. 
Thanks, 
Mike Brown

INTRODUCTION  
 
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B [Lot 2 Section 19, 
T153N, R100W] is located approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston in McKenzie 
County, North Dakota. The Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B is a horizontal Middle Bakken well within 
the Williston Basin consisting of one 9,369' (uncased) lateral drilled toward the east. The vertical 
hole was planned to be drilled to approximately 10,230’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees 
per 100’ to land within the Middle Bakken. This well is a two section lateral which originates in 
the northwest quarter of section 19, then drilled east to the northeast quarter of section 20. 
Directional drilling technologies and geosteering techniques were used to land in the Middle 
Bakken reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock. 
 
 
 
 
OFFSET WELLS  
Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the ‘Control 
Data’ section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in curve operations, to 
successfully land within the Middle Bakken. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray 
signatures in these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in 
order to successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was 
periodically updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.  
 
GEOLOGY 
 
The Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 8,535' MD 8,535' TVD        
(-6,459' SS). Samples in the lower portion of the Charles Formation consisted of a limestone 
mudstone, which was light brown, light gray brown, light gray brown, off white in color. It was 
microcrystalline, friable, laminated, with an earthy texture. A trace of intercrystalline porosity 
was observed as was occasional to rare spotty light brown oil stain. Occasionally noted was a 
dolomite mudstone, which was light brown, light gray, light gray brown in color. It was 
microcrystalline, friable-firm, laminated, with an earthy texture. Also noted was a trace of 
intercrystalline porosity, and occasional spotty light brown oil stain. Rarely noted was anhydrite, 
which was off white, cream in color. It was soft, microcrystalline, and massive with an earthy to 
amorphous texture. Following connections or periods of non-circulation, gas peaks of 40 to 42 
units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 31 to 40 units.   
 
The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,435' MD 9,435' 
TVD (-7,359' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was 
described as light gray, light brown to brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime 
mudstone was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rarely crystalline in texture. Some 
intervals contained a trace of black-brown algal material, a trace of fossil fragments, and traces 
of disseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as 
light gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The 
argillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture. 
Some intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. Gas shows of 33 to 64 units were 
present. Rare intercrystalline porosity was noted as well as traces to occasional spotty light 
brown oil stain was occasionally observed while logging the Mission Canyon Formation. 
 
The Upper Bakken Shale [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,888' MD 10,727' 
TVD (-8,651' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated 
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray carbonaceous and 
petroliferous shale was hard with a sub blocky to sub platy texture. Fracture porosity was noted, 
and trace minerals were observed to include disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill. 
Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 2,365 units drilling gas, with a 
connection gas of 2,803 units.  
 
  
Figure 2. Black carbonaceous and petroliferous shale from the Upper Bakken Shale. 
 
The Middle Bakken [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,958' MD 
10,743' TVD (-8,667' SS) which was 4’ low to the Oasis Petroleum NA LLC Chalmers 5300 21-
19 8T. The target zone of the Middle Bakken was to be drilled in a predominately ten foot zone 
beginning ten feet below the Upper Bakken Shale.  
                                       
Samples in the Middle Bakken were predominantly silty sandstone which was described as light-
medium brown, occasional light gray brown, rare light gray in color. It was very fine grained, 
firm-friable, sub rounded to sub angular, smooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement moderately 
cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was occasional intergranular 
porosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain.

Hydrocarbon Shows  
 
Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during 
the drilling of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples 
were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained 
near balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas on the 
Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which 
may have reflected increased porosity. During the vertical, gas peaks of 35 to 64 units were 
noted, against a 10.1-11.4 lb/gal diesel-invert mud 
weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged 
from 1,000 to 5,100 units, against a 9.65-10.2 lb/gal 
saltwater gel drilling fluid. Connection peaks of 2,000 to 
4,500 units were observed, as were drilling gas shows of 
2,500 units to 5,736 units coinciding with the best 
shows. Drilling out of casing at 11,127’ MD yielded a 
trip gas of 4,875 units. At 12,600’ the gas buster was 
turned on, resulting in 5’-10’ intermittent flare and a 
20’-25’ large bright orange trip flair at 14,878’. 
Chromatography of gas revealed typical concentrations 
of methane, characteristic of Middle Bakken Member 
gas.

Geosteering 
 
Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling 
(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers and MWD, and Sunburst Consulting personnel 
worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to 
maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of 
the formation.  
 
The 904’ curve was drilled in 24 hours. It was drilled with a bottom hole assembly (BHA) 
consisting of bit #3, a Security MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV stage 
7/8 5.0 motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed at 11,127’ MD and 10,758’ 
TVD, approximately 15’ into the Middle Bakken. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110 casing was 
set to 11,071’ MD.  
 
Geologic structure maps of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B and surrounding control wells had 
estimated formation dip to be a down dip at approximately 0.5º down to the TD of the lateral. 
The preferred drilling interval of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B consisted of a ten foot zone 
located approximately ten feet into the Middle Bakken. Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray 
data, and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred stratigraphic 
position in the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis representatives, projected 
porosity zones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.  
 
 
 
Figure 6.  Offset well target definition, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).   
 
Steering decisions were made by using gamma markers identified by Oasis representatives. The 
high gamma (C) in the upper portion of the drilling zone was useful in identifying the well bore 
placement in formation. The slightly lower gamma (B) was observed as the well bore moved to 
the top of the target zone, followed by lower gamma as the well bore moved higher, out of the 
target zone. Low gamma in the middle of the target zone (D) was noted as the well bore moved 
to the middle of the target zone. As the well bore moved lower in formation, the higher gamma 
(E) was noted as was lower gamma as the well bore moved lower in formation, exiting the target 
zone. Samples collected when drilling below the target zone tended to have a greater 
concentration of the light gray to gray silty sandstone than did the samples collected when the 
well bore was higher in the target zone. The TD of 20,440’ MD was achieved at 16:40 hours 
CST February 26, 2015. The well site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the 
desired target interval for 77% of the lateral, opening 9,369’ of potentially productive reservoir 
rock. The hole was then circulated and reamed for completion. 
 
SUMMARY  
 
The Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle 
Bakken development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD 
in 20 days. The TD of 20,440’ MD was achieved at 16:40 hours CST February 26, 2015. The 
well site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval for 77% of 
the lateral, opening 9,369’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.  
 
Samples in the Middle Bakken were predominantly silty sandstone which was described as light-
medium brown, occasional light gray brown, rare light gray in color. It was very fine grained, 
firm-friable, sub rounded to sub angular, smooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement moderately 
cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was occasional intergranular 
porosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain.  
 
Gas on the Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration 
rates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and hydrocarbon shows were 
encouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Middle Bakken. 
 
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B awaits completion 
operations to determine its ultimate production potential.

LITHOLOGY 
Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC 
Chalmers 5300 21-19 11B 
 
Rig crews caught 30’ sample intervals, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, from 8,240’ to the 
TD of the lateral at 20,440’. Formation tops and lithologic markers have been inserted into the sample 
descriptions below for reference.  Sample descriptions begin in the Kibbey Formation just prior to the 
Kibbey Lime.  Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope. Sample fluorescent 
cuts are masked by invert mud through intermediate casing. Quantifiers in order of increasing abundance 
are trace, rare, occasional, common and abundant.

Well File # 28648 
 
Dear Brandi: 
 
   Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The 
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than 
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 19 &20 T153N R100W.  
 
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required 
surrounding the entire location. Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for 
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must 
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are 
conducted. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-7703-
554 prior to location construction. 
 
Drilling pit 
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well 
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will 
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits 
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings 
pit.” 
 
Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines  
  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum 
legal coordinate from the well head is: 9963’ east. 
 
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) 
   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the 
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to 
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may 
be waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information 
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other 
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the 
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification 
   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested 
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the 
Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal 
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are 
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a 
message if after hours or on the weekend.  
 
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells 
   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor 
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys 
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may 
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the 
operation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe 
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve 
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. 
 
Surface casing cement 
 
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi 
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.   
 
Logs 
 
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and 
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and 
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation 
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log 
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to 
digitallogs@nd.gov 
   
Thank you for your cooperation.

RE:  Filter Socks and Other Filter Media 
 
 
 
 
Leakproof Container Required 
 
 
 
 
Oil and Gas Wells 
 
Dear Operator, 
 
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with 
exploration or production of oil and  gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all 
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations. 
 
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota.  The Commission is very 
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. 
 
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the 
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations 
are conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an 
authorized facility.  Such containers must be: 
 
leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container 
 
covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container 
 
placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container 
 
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but 
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. 
 
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production 
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste 
Management.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the 
solid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, 
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  
 
Thank you for your cooperation.  
 
 
 
Sincerely,
