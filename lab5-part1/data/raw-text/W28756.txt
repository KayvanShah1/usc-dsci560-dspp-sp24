INTRODUCTION
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B [Lot 3 Section 18,
T153N, R100W] is located in Baker Field of the Williston Basin in western North Dakota. This
section lies approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston and adjacent to Lake
Sakakawea in McKenzie County. The Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B is a horizontal Middle
Bakken well, in a double-section, laydown spacing unit permitted to drill to the east from the
surface location within Section 18, continuing through Section 17 to the proposed bottom-hole
location (PBHL) in that section. There are 500’ setbacks along the north and south borders and
200’ setbacks from the east and west borders within the 1,280 acre spacing unit. The well
consists of one Middle Bakken lateral. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to
approximately 10,221’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the
Middle Bakken. Directional drilling technologies and geosteering techniques were used to land
in the Middle Bakken reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock. Oasis Petroleum
is targeting a silty sandstone facies of the Middle Bakken with intent to intersect porosity and
fracture trends enhancing reservoir quality.
OFFSET WELLS
Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the ‘Control
Data’ section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in providing control data,
making it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and landing target depth. By
referencing the gamma signature of these offsets, a model was formed for the target intervalpinpointing a strategic landing. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in
these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in order to
successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was periodically
updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.
GEOLOGY
The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,391' MD 9,390'
TVD (-7,357' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was
described as light gray, light brown to brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime
mudstone was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rare crystalline texture. Some
intervals contained a trace of black-brown algal material, traces of fossil fragments, and traces of
disseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as light
gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The
argillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture.
Some intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. Gas shows were not present. Rare
intercrystalline porosity was noted as well as trace spotty light brown oil stain while logging the
Mission Canyon Formation.
The Upper Bakken Shale [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,866'
MD 10,676' TVD (-8,643' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma,
elevated background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray
carbonaceous and petroliferous shale was hard with a sub blocky to sub platy texture. Fracture
porosity was noted, and trace minerals were observed including disseminated pyrite and calcite
fracture fill. Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 4,577 units of
drilling gas.
The Middle Bakken [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,926' MD
10,693' TVD (-8,660' SS) which was -6’ low to the Oasis Petroleum NA LLC Kline Federal
5300 31-19 8B. The target zone of the Middle Bakken was to be drilled in a predominately 16
foot zone beginning 12 feet below the Upper Bakken Shale. Samples in the Middle Bakken were
predominantly silty sandstone which was described as light-medium brown, occasional light gray
brown, rare light gray in color. It was very fine grained, firm-friable, sub rounded to sub angular,
smooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement moderately cemented. A trace of disseminated and
nodular pyrite was noted as was occasional intergranular porosity. Also noted was common light
to medium brown spotty to even oil stain.
Figure 2 & 3. Predominate silty sandstone dry (Left) and wet (Right) samples from the target zone.Hydrocarbon Shows
Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during
the drilling of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples
were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained
near balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas varied
according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which may have reflected increased
porosity. During the vertical, gas peaks of 23 to 75 units were noted, against a 9.4-10.2 lb/gal
diesel-invert mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 100 to 4,100
units, against a 9.57-9.6 lb/gal saltwater gel drilling fluid. Connection peaks of 3,000 to 5,000
units were observed, as were drilling gas shows of 500 units to 5,690 units coinciding with the
best shows. Chromatography of gas revealed typical concentrations of methane, ethane, propane
and butane characteristic of Middle Bakken Member gas.

Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling
(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers, MWD, and Sunburst Consulting personnel
worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to
maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of
the formation.
The 1,068’ curve was drilled in 26 hours. It was drilled with a bottom hole assembly (BHA)
consisting of bit #4, a Security MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV stage
7/8 5.0 motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed at 11,182’ MD and 10,719’
TVD, approximately 26’ into the Middle Bakken. Seven inch diameter 29# & 32# HCP-110
intermediate casing was set to 11,108’ MD.
Geologic structure maps of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B and surrounding control wells had
estimated gross formation dip to be down at approximately -0.2º to the TD of the lateral. The
preferred drilling interval consisted of a sixteen foot zone located approximately twelve feet into
the Middle Bakken. Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data, and sample observations were
utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred stratigraphic position in the target zone. Using
offset well data provided by Oasis representatives, projected porosity zones were identified in the
preferred drilling areas.

Steering decisions were made by using gamma markers identified by Oasis representatives. The
high gamma (C) in the central portion of the drilling zone was useful in identifying the well-bore
placement in formation. The slightly lower gamma (between B & C) was observed as the well-
bore moved to the top of the target zone, followed by lower gamma as the well-bore moved
higher, out of the target zone. Low gamma in the middle of the target zone (D) was noted as the
well-bore moved to the middle of the target zone. Samples collected when drilling below the
target zone tended to have a greater concentration of the light gray to gray silty sandstone than
did the samples collected when the well-bore was higher in the target zone. This lateral was
drilled in 4 days from casing exit to TD, with one necessitated trip at 11,936’ for a MWD tool
failure at which time the bit was replaced. Well site teams worked closely together with
directional to maximize penetration rates averaging 200 to 280 feet per hour while rotating,
resulting in 2 days of over 3,000’ of lateral progress. The well site team was able to keep the well
bore in the desired target the entire well with the exception of approximately 800’ at 17,850’
when the wellbore was drilled below the preferred target interval. The TD of 20,597’ MD was
achieved at 23:30 hours CST April 15, 2015. The wellbore was completed with 92% of the
lateral in target, opening 9,489’ (measurement taken from uncased lateral portion) of potentially
productive reservoir rock. The hole was then circulated and reamed for completion.SUMMARY
The Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle
Bakken development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD
in 12 days. The TD of 20,597’ MD was achieved at 23:30 hours CST April 15, 2015. The well
site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval for 92% of the
lateral, opening 9,489’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.
Samples in the Middle Bakken were predominantly silty sandstone which was described as light-
medium brown, occasional light gray brown, rare light gray in color. It was very fine grained,
firm-friable, sub rounded to sub angular, smooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement moderately
cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was occasional intergranular
porosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain.
Gas on the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B varied according to stratigraphic position and
penetration rates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and hydrocarbon
shows were encouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Middle Bakken.
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B awaits completion
operations to determine its ultimate production potential.

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC
Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B
Rig crews caught 30’ sample intervals, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, from 8,240’
to the TD of the lateral at 20,597’. Formation tops and lithologic markers have been inserted into
the sample descriptions below for reference. Sample descriptions begin in the Kibbey Formation
just prior to the Kibbey Lime. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular
microscope. Sample fluorescent cuts are masked by invert mud through intermediate casing.
Quantifiers in order of increasing abundance are trace, rare, occasional, common and abundant.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC requests a variance to rule 43-02-03-31 requiring electrical, radioactive or other
similar logs to be run to determine formation tops and zones of porosity. The surface location of this well will be
very near our Kline Federal 5300 11-18H (API #33-053-03426 NDIC # 20275) in Lot 1, Section 18, T153N, R100W and
the logs run on this well should be sufficient to determine formation tops in the vertical section of the well bore. As
outlined in our application for permit to drill, Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC will run gamma ray logs from KOP
to the total depth and cement bond log from the production casing total depth to surface. Two digital copies of all
mud logs (one tif and one las) will be submitted to the NDIC.

RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
KLINE FEDERAL 5300 31-18 6B
LOT3 Section 18-153N-100W
McKenzie County
Well File # 28756
Dear Lauri:
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 17 & 18 T153N R100W.
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are
conducted. Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the
entire location. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-
770-3554 prior to location construction.
Drilling pit
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings
pit.”
Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10051’ east.
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.Lauri M. Stanfield

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.
Surface casing cement
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.
Logs
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to
digitallogs@nd.gov

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells
Dear Operator,
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
Bruce E. Hicks

INTRODUCTION 
 
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B [Lot 3 Section 18, 
T153N, R100W] is located in Baker Field of the Williston Basin in western North Dakota. This 
section lies approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston and adjacent to Lake 
Sakakawea in McKenzie County. The  Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B is a horizontal Middle 
Bakken well, in a double-section, laydown spacing unit permitted to drill to the east  from the 
surface location within Section 18, continuing through Section 17 to the proposed bottom-hole 
location (PBHL) in that section. There are 500’ setbacks along the north and south borders and 
200’ setbacks from the east and west borders within the 1,280 acre spacing unit. The well 
consists of one Middle Bakken lateral. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to 
approximately 10,221’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the 
Middle Bakken. Directional drilling technologies and geosteering techniques were used to land 
in the Middle Bakken reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.  Oasis Petroleum 
is targeting a silty sandstone facies of the Middle Bakken with intent to intersect porosity and 
fracture trends enhancing reservoir quality. 
 
OFFSET WELLS 
 
Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the ‘Control 
Data’ section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in providing control data, 
making it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and landing target depth. By 
referencing the gamma signature of these offsets, a model was formed for the target interval 
pinpointing a strategic landing.  Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in 
these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in order to 
successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was periodically 
updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.  
 
GEOLOGY 
 
The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,391' MD 9,390' 
TVD (-7,357' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was 
described as light gray, light brown to brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime 
mudstone was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rare crystalline texture. Some 
intervals contained a trace of black-brown algal material, traces of fossil fragments, and traces of 
disseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as light 
gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The 
argillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture. 
Some intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. Gas shows were not present. Rare 
intercrystalline porosity was noted as well as trace spotty light brown oil stain while logging the 
Mission Canyon Formation. 
 
The Upper Bakken Shale [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,866' 
MD 10,676' TVD (-8,643' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, 
elevated background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray 
carbonaceous and petroliferous shale was hard with a sub blocky to sub platy texture. Fracture 
porosity was noted, and trace minerals were observed including disseminated pyrite and calcite 
fracture fill. Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 4,577 units of 
drilling gas. 
 
The Middle Bakken [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,926' MD 
10,693' TVD (-8,660' SS) which was -6’ low to the Oasis Petroleum NA LLC Kline Federal 
5300 31-19 8B. The target zone of the Middle Bakken was to be drilled in a predominately 16 
foot zone beginning 12 feet below the Upper Bakken Shale. Samples in the Middle Bakken were 
predominantly silty sandstone which was described as light-medium brown, occasional light gray 
brown, rare light gray in color. It was very fine grained, firm-friable, sub rounded to sub angular, 
smooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement moderately cemented. A trace of disseminated and 
nodular pyrite was noted as was occasional intergranular porosity. Also noted was common light 
to medium brown spotty to even oil stain.

Hydrocarbon Shows  
 
Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during 
the drilling of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples 
were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained 
near balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas varied 
according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which may have reflected increased 
porosity. During the vertical, gas peaks of 23 to 75 units were noted, against a 9.4-10.2 lb/gal 
diesel-invert mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 100 to 4,100 
units, against a 9.57-9.6 lb/gal saltwater gel drilling fluid. Connection peaks of 3,000 to 5,000 
units were observed, as were drilling gas shows of 500 units to 5,690 units coinciding with the 
best shows. Chromatography of gas revealed typical concentrations of methane, ethane, propane 
and butane characteristic of Middle Bakken Member gas.

Geosteering 
 
Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling 
(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers, MWD, and Sunburst Consulting personnel 
worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to 
maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of 
the formation.  
 
The 1,068’ curve was drilled in 26 hours. It was drilled with a bottom hole assembly (BHA) 
consisting of bit #4, a Security MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV stage 
7/8 5.0 motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed at 11,182’ MD and 10,719’ 
TVD, approximately 26’ into the Middle Bakken. Seven inch diameter 29# & 32# HCP-110 
intermediate casing was set to 11,108’ MD.  
 
Geologic structure maps of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B and surrounding control wells had 
estimated gross formation dip to be down at approximately -0.2º to the TD of the lateral. The 
preferred drilling interval consisted of a sixteen foot zone located approximately twelve feet into 
the Middle Bakken. Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data, and sample observations were 
utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred stratigraphic position in the target zone. Using 
offset well data provided by Oasis representatives, projected porosity zones were identified in the 
preferred drilling areas.

Steering decisions were made by using gamma markers identified by Oasis representatives. The 
high gamma (C) in the central portion of the drilling zone was useful in identifying the well-bore 
placement in formation. The slightly lower gamma (between B & C) was observed as the well-
bore moved to the top of the target zone, followed by lower gamma as the well-bore moved 
higher, out of the target zone. Low gamma in the middle of the target zone (D) was noted as the 
well-bore moved to the middle of the target zone. Samples collected when drilling below the 
target zone tended to have a greater concentration of the light gray to gray silty sandstone than 
did the samples collected when the well-bore was higher in the target zone. This lateral was 
drilled in 4 days from casing exit to TD, with one necessitated trip at 11,936’ for a MWD tool 
failure at which time the bit was replaced. Well site teams worked closely together with 
directional to maximize penetration rates averaging 200 to 280 feet per hour while rotating, 
resulting in 2 days of over 3,000’ of lateral progress. The well site team was able to keep the well 
bore in the desired target the entire well with the exception of approximately 800’ at 17,850’ 
when the wellbore was drilled below the preferred target interval. The TD of 20,597’ MD was 
achieved at 23:30 hours CST April 15, 2015. The wellbore was completed with 92% of the 
lateral in target, opening 9,489’ (measurement taken from uncased lateral portion) of potentially 
productive reservoir rock. The hole was then circulated and reamed for completion. 
 
SUMMARY  
 
The Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle 
Bakken development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD 
in 12 days. The TD of 20,597’ MD was achieved at 23:30 hours CST April 15, 2015. The well 
site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval for 92% of the 
lateral, opening 9,489’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.  
 
Samples in the Middle Bakken were predominantly silty sandstone which was described as light-
medium brown, occasional light gray brown, rare light gray in color. It was very fine grained, 
firm-friable, sub rounded to sub angular, smooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement moderately 
cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was occasional intergranular 
porosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain.  
 
Gas on the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B varied according to stratigraphic position and 
penetration rates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and hydrocarbon 
shows were encouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Middle Bakken. 
 
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B awaits completion 
operations to determine its ultimate production potential.

LITHOLOGY 
Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC 
Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B 
 
Rig crews caught 30’ sample intervals, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, from 8,240’ 
to the TD of the lateral at 20,597’. Formation tops and lithologic markers have been inserted into 
the sample descriptions below for reference.  Sample descriptions begin in the Kibbey Formation 
just prior to the Kibbey Lime.  Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular 
microscope. Sample fluorescent cuts are masked by invert mud through intermediate casing. 
Quantifiers in order of increasing abundance are trace, rare, occasional, common and abundant.

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC requests a variance to rule 43-02-03-31 requiring electrical, radioactive or other 
similar logs to be run to determine formation tops and zones of porosity. The surface location of this well will be 
very near our Kline Federal 5300 11-18H (API #33-053-03426 NDIC # 20275) in Lot 1, Section 18, T153N, R100W and 
the logs run on this well should be sufficient to determine formation tops in the vertical section of the well bore. As 
outlined in our application for permit to drill, Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC will run gamma ray logs from KOP 
to the total depth and cement bond log from the production casing total depth to surface. Two digital copies of all 
mud logs (one tif and one las) will be submitted to the NDIC.

Dear Lauri: 
 
   Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The 
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than 
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 17 & 18 T153N R100W.  
 
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for 
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must 
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are 
conducted. Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the 
entire location. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-
770-3554 prior to location construction. 
 
Drilling pit 
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well 
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will 
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits 
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings 
pit.” 
 
Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines  
  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum 
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10051’ east. 
 
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) 
   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the 
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to 
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may 
be waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information 
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other 
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the 
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification 
   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested 
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the 
Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal 
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are 
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a 
message if after hours or on the weekend.  
 
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells 
   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor 
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys 
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may 
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the 
operation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe 
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve 
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. 
 
Surface casing cement 
 
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi 
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.   
 
Logs 
 
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and 
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and 
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation 
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log 
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to 
digitallogs@nd.gov

RE:  Filter Socks and Other Filter Media 
 
 
 
 
Leakproof Container Required 
 
 
 
 
Oil and Gas Wells 
 
Dear Operator, 
 
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with 
exploration or production of oil and  gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all 
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations. 
 
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota.  The Commission is very 
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. 
 
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the 
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations 
are conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an 
authorized facility.  Such containers must be: 
 
leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container 
 
covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container 
 
placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container 
 
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but 
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. 
 
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production 
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste 
Management.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the 
solid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, 
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  
 
Thank you for your cooperation.  
 
 
 
Sincerely,
