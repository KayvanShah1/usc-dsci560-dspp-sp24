drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings
pit.”
Permit Fee & Notification
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be
given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas

Confidential status
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his

for six months commencing on the date the well is spud.
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all
well records wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your

drilling rig operated or controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records

Commission's field personnel periodically inspect producing and drilling wells. Any information
regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time upon request. The information so
obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and shall be available only to the

Surface casing cement
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
within 12 hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive
strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.
Logs
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to
digitallogs@nd.gov Thank you for your cooperation.

Well File # 90258 
 
Dear Terry : 
 
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 21271, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given.     
 
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: This well is located on a Well Head Protection Area:  Onsite inspection required 
(contact NDIC Field Inspector for site specific stipulations).  To include but not limited to: Closed Mud System, 
no drilling pit, and impermeable liner is required on the entire location and a string of casing must be placed in 
the rat and mouse hole and cemented to ground level.  CONTINENTAL RESOURCES must contact NDIC 
Field Inspector John Axtman at 701-770-2564 prior to location construction. 
 
Drilling pit 
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well 
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will 
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits 
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings 
pit.” 
 
Permit Fee & Notification 
 
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card.  It is requested that notification be 
given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas 
Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal 
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office 
hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is 
(701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.

Confidential status 
 
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his 
representatives, is hereby granted.  Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential 
for six months commencing on the date the well is spud. 
 
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all 
well records wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your 
company shall permit the Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or 
drilling rig operated or controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records 
and operation of such wells and to have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The 
Commission's field personnel periodically inspect producing and drilling wells.  Any information 
regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time upon request.  The information so 
obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and shall be available only to the 
Commission and its staff. 
 
Surface casing cement 
 
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi 
within 12 hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive 
strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.   
 
Logs 
 
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and 
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and 
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation 
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log 
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to 
digitallogs@nd.gov   Thank you for your cooperation.
