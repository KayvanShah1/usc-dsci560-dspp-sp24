County, North Dakota (All photos by Dillon Johnson unless noted otherwise).
Introduction
The Oasis Petroleum NA, LLC. Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B is located in Baker Field of the Williston
Basin [Lot 2 Section 31, T153N, R101W]. The subject well lies approximately 8 miles south of the town
of Williston, in McKenzie County, North Dakota (Figure 1). The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B is the first
of two wells to be drilled on the Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 pad. This pad is set up as a 1,280 acre laydown
spacing unit, with 500’ N/S and 100’ E/W drilling setbacks. The subject well is permitted to drill east from
the surface location in section 31 into section 32. The well consists of a single Middle Bakken Member
lateral, targeting a silty sandstone facies, with intent to intersect porosity and fracture trends enhancing
reservoir quality.
Engineering Operations Overview
The 13 3/8” surface casing for the subject well was preset at a depth of 3,325’ prior to Nabors B21 arrival.
Nabors B21 reentered the subject well on April 16, 2019. Due to the presence of several salt water disposal
wells in the immediate area the decision was made to set a 9 5/8” isolation casing string through the Inyan
Kara and into the Swift. The isolation portion was drilled without issue to a depth of 6,097’. The 9 5/8”
casing was then set to set to a depth of 6,077’. The remainder of the vertical hole was completed with two
8.75” assemblies. The first vertical assembly drilled to a depth of 8,485’ before being replace due to low
ROP, the second vertical assembly drilled to a depth of 10,270’ (KOP). While drilling in the Mission
Canyon, at a depth of 9,821’ the driller noticed that the mud volume was increasing. A flow test indicated
that the well was taking on water. A cement bond log will be run at a later date, but as of this report, it is
assumed that the cement job on the 9 5/8” casing string was poor and lead to water from the Inyan Kara
flowing into the wellbore. To resolve the water flow for the time being, the drilling choke was engaged to
increase pressure on the back side of the drill pipe and hold back the water flow. From 9,821’-10,270’ ~350
psi casing back pressure was maintained to reduce the water influx.The curve assembly consisted of a Reed TKC56 PDC bit (#4), attached to a 2.38° NOV mud motor and
Scientific Drilling MWD tools drilled to a depth of 11,148’ (casing point). At a depth of 11,325’ while
attempting to slowly reduce flow with the drilling choke, the choke was accidently closed completely
resulting in a dramatic increase in pressure. Shortly after this incident fluid losses we observed at a
substantial rate. It is assumed that with the increase in pressure the Mission Canyon began to absorb fluid.
From this depth to casing point there was a substantial amount of LCM pumped down hole. To keep the
LCM in the drilling fluid the shaker screens were removed and not used until cement operations for the 7”
casing began. The curve was successfully landed at 11,148’ MD and 10,786’ TVD, approximately 12’
below the Upper Bakken Shale on April 25, 2019. Seven inch diameter 32# P-110 intermediate casing was
set to 11,130’ MD at landing.
The lateral was completed using two 6” assemblies. The first lateral assembly drilled to a depth of 15,739’
before a trip was required due to an MWD failure. Prior to the MWD failure the decision was made to
sidetrack due to the potential proximity to the Upper Bakken Shale (please see details below in the
Geosteering portion of this report). The sidetrack was kicked off on the first attempt, at a depth of 15,620’.
While replacing the faulty MWD tool, the bit and mud motor were also replaced. The second lateral
assembly drilled the remainder of the lateral. The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B reached a total depth of
20,860’ on May 3, 2019.
Offset Control
Offset well data can be found in the ‘Control Data’ section appended to this report. Offset wells were
essential in providing control, making it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and curve landing
target depth. The three primary offsets were, The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal
5300 11-31 4BR, the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H, and the Oasis
Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 3B. By referencing the gamma signature of these
offsets and using formation thicknesses, a model was formed for the target interval pinpointing a strategic
landing. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in these offset wells were compared to
gamma data collected during drilling operations in to successfully land the curve.
Geology
Sample evaluation began in the Otter Formation at 8,300’ measured depth (MD). Lagged samples were
caught by Sunburst personnel in 30’ intervals through the vertical and curve, and 50’ intervals in the lateral.
Rock samples were evaluated under wet and dry conditions using a stereo zoom binocular microscope for
the identification of lithology including the presence of porosity and oil. Only observed prospective intervals
are described here, but detailed lithological descriptions for all formations are provided in the ‘Lithology’
appendix.
The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian, Madison Group] was logged at 9,473' MD, 9,466’ TVD
(-7,309' MSL). The Mission Canyon Formation is described as cream,
tan, light gray, and light brown gray in color. Samples are
predominately microcrystalline and are a firm mudstone. The
limestone has an earthy, rarely crystalline texture. Also noted in in
several samples were trace fossil fragments. The limestone is
argillaceous in part throughout this interval. In certain areas possible
intercrystalline porosity was noted but there was no significant oil
staining observed in samples. Throughout the Mission Canyon gas
shows are promising, with an average background gasses ~360u with
several connection gasses exceeding 1000u. It should be noted that
prior to the drilling choke being used to hold ~350psi casing back

pressure, gas show was much higher (~510u background gas) than
Mission Canyon.
those observed with the casing back pressure (135u background gas).The Bakken Formation
The Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian] was recorded at 10,963' MD, 10,759’ TVD (-8,602'
MSL). Entry into this member is characterized by high gamma counts (>300 API), elevated background
gas and increased rates of penetration. While drilling through the Upper Bakken Shale gas a background
gas of 580u was observed, as well as several gas shows exceeding 800u. The distinct black shale is
carbonaceous and petroliferous, as well as, hard and platy. Minerals including disseminated/nodular pyrite
and trace calcite fracture fill was observed.
The Middle Bakken Member [Mississippian-Devonian] was
entered at 11,020’ MD, 10,774' TVD (-8,617' MSL). Samples in
the Middle Bakken are predominantly a light brown, light brown
gray, light to medium gray, silty sandstone. The silty sandstone is
fine to very fine grained, and firm. The Middle Bakken typically
contained sub-round to sub-angular grains. Samples are smooth,
moderately sorted and poorly cemented by calcite. Rare to trace
quantities of disseminated and nodular pyrite is present as was
trace to fair intergranular porosity. Trace to rare light-medium
brown, spotty oil stain was visible in many of these samples.
While drilling the Middle Bakken background gasses ranged from
~700 to 3500 units while several shows exceeded 4500u.

Geosteering
Structure maps provided by Oasis Petroleum projected the structure would have an overall down dip
averaging -0.50º. Below are the two nearest offset wells to the Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B. The Lewis
Federal 5300 11-21 4BR (Figure 4), drilling west to east, ~0.30 miles north of the subject well, and the
Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H (Figure 5), drilling west to east, ~0.20 miles south of the subject well.
Although the nearby offsets all had an overall dip rate of -0.50º, the structure near a vertical section of
4,700’ varied considerably. The Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H has a very consistent downward dip rate of
approximately -0.50 throughout the course of the lateral. While the Lewis Federal 5300 11-21 4BR has a
constant downward dip rate until ~4,700’ vertical section, where the structure abruptly dips down at a steep
>2º for several hundred feet before flattening, reversing to a steep >1.5º up dip for several hundred feet,
then returning to dip rate more similar to that of regional structure. In total the synclinal structure observed
on the Lewis Federal 5300 11-21 4BR lasted for ~1,950’. The steering team recognized that if the structure
on the subject well was to be irregular, and similar to the Lewis Federal 5300 11-21 4BR, that this irregular
structure would be observed from 4,000’-7,000’ vertical section.Figure 4. Cross-sectional profile of the Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4BR displaying stratigraphic position and gamma values.
Figure 5. Cross-sectional profile of the Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H displaying stratigraphic position and gamma values.
The 18’ target interval for the subject well is 9’ below the Upper Bakken Shale and 9’ above the Lower
Bakken Shale. Prior to drilling out of the 7” casing it was determined that the C marker near the center of
target and the featureless D marker in the lower portion of the Middle Bakken were to be the primary
steering guides throughout the course of the lateral (Figure 6). For the first ~3,200’ of the lateral the
structure observed was similar to regional structure, with dip rates of -0.15º to -0.85º being calculated. As
the wellbore ascended above the target interval at ~18,300’ it became apparent that the structure was
dipping down at a steep >1º rate. While drilling ahead the possibility of the structure dipping down at >2º
was anticipated. As the MWD data collected from the survey at 15,651’ was analyzed it was realized that
the structure had begun to dip down at a very steep >2º angle. At this time the steering teams profile placed
the wellbore at the top of the target interval. Unfortunately, simultaneously as the structure began to dip
down at a steep angle, the assembly also began to build a considerable amount of inclination (continuousinclination of 91.5º). At a measured depth of 15,739’ a stop card was pulled to assess the wellbores position
within the Middle Bakken. At the time of the stop card there were no drilling parameters that would indicate
an Upper Bakken Shale strike, and a bottoms up sample did not display any shale. When the data was
assessed it was determined that the structure could possibly be dipping down at -2.35º, and that the wellbore
could be as close as 1’ from the Upper Bakken Shale. To avoid a potential shale strike Oasis Petroleum
decided that the safest course of action would be to pull back to a depth of 15,620’ and begin a sidetrack.
As the sidetrack was being troughed the MWD tool failed and a trip was required. After the required trip
the wellbore was successfully sidetracked on the first attempt. After the sidetrack the structure continued
to dip down at a steep -1.4º to 2.3º until a MD of 16,125’. From a MD of 16,125’- 16,960’ the structure
appeared to be relatively flat before turning up-dip for ~500’. In total the irregular synclinal structure was
observed for ~3,150’ MD of drilling. This structure should be anticipated if more wells are to be drilled
within the DSU in the future. Aside from a brief 340’
when the wellbore ascended above the target interval,
the wellbore drilled within the target interval from the
sidetrack point to 20,860’ TD. Over the course of the
lateral, gamma markers throughout the target interval
were relatively inconsistent and difficult to interpret.
Two of the more dependable steering guides were a
cool marker above the target interval, and a relatively
warm marker near the top of the target zone. Although
the cool was semi-consistent, due to the close
proximity to the Upper Bakken Shale, it was not used
as a primary steering guide. The warm marker ~4’
from the top of the target interval was a good
reference for the wellbore’s position within the
member but was not consistently observed while
drilling in the upper portion of the target interval.
Regardless of position in zone the assembly regularly
built inclination on rotation. There did not appear to
be any noticeable hard streaks or intervals that were
more or less favorable in relation to ROP.
Figure 6. Target definition for the Oasis Petroleum, Lewis
Federal 5300 21-31 5B.
The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B had an estimated overall formation dip of approximately -0.54º.
Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data, and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore
in the preferred stratigraphic position within the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis
representatives, the target interval was determined to maintain adequate distance from the shale and used
as preferred drilling areas.
The lateral was drilled in less than 5 days from casing exit to total depth, with two lateral assemblies. A
total depth of 20,860’ MD was achieved at 05:20 hours on May 3, 2019. The wellbore was completed 95%
within target, opening 9,730’ (measurement taken from uncased lateral portion) of potentially productive
reservoir rock.
Hydrocarbon Shows
Gas was continuously recorded from 8,300’ to the completion of the lateral, along with the monitoring of
free oil at the possum belly and shakers. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained
near balance, this allowed gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. During the vertical, gas shows
ranging from 10 to 1860 units were noted, against a 10.10 to 10.95 pound per gallon (PPG) diesel-invert,
mud weight. Due to water influx from the Inyan Kara, casing back pressure was utilized from 9,821’ to11,148’. This increase pressure simulates a higher mud weight and reduced hydrocarbon shows.
Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 700 to 3500 units, against a 9.4-9.45 PPG saltwater
gel drilling fluid (Figure 7). Chromatography of gas revealed typical concentrations of methane, ethane
and propane characteristic of the Middle Bakken (Figure 8). Sample cuttings were examined for
hydrocarbon “cut” by immersion of trichloroethylene and inspection under a UV fluoroscope. Fluorescent
cuts were generally pale yellow in color and had a diffuse habit at a slow to moderate speed.

values.

The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B is a well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle Bakken Member
development program, in the Indian Hill prospect of McKenzie County, North Dakota. The project was
drilled from surface casing to total depth in 17 days. Due to the wellbore proximity to the Upper Bakken
Shale a sidetrack was utilized at a depth of 15,620’. A total depth of 20,860’ MD was achieved at 05:20
hours on May 3, 2019. The well-site team worked together to maintain the wellbore in the desired target
interval for 95% within target, opening 9,730’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.
Samples in the Middle Bakken Member are predominantly silty sandstone. These samples are light brown,
light brown gray, light to medium gray silty sandstone. The silty sandstone is fine to very fine grained. The
middle member typically contained sub-round and occasionally sub-angular grains. Samples are smooth,
moderately sorted and poorly cemented by calcite. Rare quantities of disseminated and nodular pyrite are
present as was trace to fair intergranular porosity. Trace to rare light-medium brown, spotty oil stain was
visible in many of these samples. The overall hydrocarbon “cuts”, gas and hydrocarbon shows were
encouraging and indicate an oil and gas rich system in the Middle Bakken Member.
The well should be regarded as an engineering and geological success based on the combination of:
• Maximum exposure to the target
• Minimal days from re-entry to total depth
• No shale strikes
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B awaits completion operations to
determine its ultimate production potential and commercial value.

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC
Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B
Sunburst geologists caught 30’ sample intervals from 8,300’-11,148’ and 50’ sample intervals through the
lateral to TD at 20,860’. Additional spot samples were caught through the vertical, curve, and lateral as
needed. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope. Sample fluorescent cuts are
masked by invert mud through 11,148’, at which time the drilling fluid was displaced to Salt Water.
Quantifiers in order of increasing abundance are trace, rare, occasional, common and abundant. One set
of sample cuttings were packaged and mailed to the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library, per
state requirement.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis Petroleum respectfully requests to amend the surface casing depth to 3300' MD (previously (2157') due to
potential flowback In the Dakota formation. In order to counteract projected flowback at surface, Oasis needs to
increase mud weight, and lowering the surface casing point will allow this to be performed safely. ADV tool will not
be used.
Attached are revised drill plans reflecting the amended casing points, cement volumes, and other related volumes.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under NDAC
43-02-03-55. Oasis Intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a
small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the
Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations
of the surface casing. Once the surface casing Is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the
casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting Into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the
location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APO. The
undersigned states that this request for suspension of drllling operations In accordance with the Subsection 4 of
Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using
an Initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not Intended to alter or extend
the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage In or under the
spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding
confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction If the well
pad is located In a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site
if the well ls not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.
Oasis must notify NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn @701-770-3554 with spud and TD.

RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
LEWIS FEDERAL 5300 31-31 10B
LOT3 Section 31-153N-100W
McKenzie County
Well File # 28194
Dear Lauri:
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 31 & 32 T153N R100W.
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to a drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding
the entire location. Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock
disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site
during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. OASIS
PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location
construction.
Drilling pit
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings
pit.”
Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10084 E.
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.Lauri M. Stanfield

Permit Fee & Notification
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the
Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a
message if after hours or on the weekend.
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.
Surface casing cement
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.
Logs
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to
digitallogs@nd.gov

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells
Dear Operator,
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
Bruce E. Hicks

Introduction 
 
The Oasis Petroleum NA, LLC. Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B is located in Baker Field of the Williston 
Basin [Lot 2 Section 31, T153N, R101W]. The subject well lies approximately 8 miles south of the town 
of Williston, in McKenzie County, North Dakota (Figure 1). The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B is the first 
of two wells to be drilled on the Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 pad. This pad is set up as a 1,280 acre laydown 
spacing unit, with 500’ N/S and 100’ E/W drilling setbacks. The subject well is permitted to drill east from 
the surface location in section 31 into section 32. The well consists of a single Middle Bakken Member 
lateral, targeting a silty sandstone facies, with intent to intersect porosity and fracture trends enhancing 
reservoir quality. 
Engineering Operations Overview 
 
The 13 3/8” surface casing for the subject well was preset at a depth of 3,325’ prior to Nabors B21 arrival. 
Nabors B21 reentered the subject well on April 16, 2019. Due to the presence of several salt water disposal 
wells in the immediate area the decision was made to set a 9 5/8” isolation casing string through the Inyan 
Kara and into the Swift. The isolation portion was drilled without issue to a depth of 6,097’. The 9 5/8” 
casing was then set to set to a depth of 6,077’. The remainder of the vertical hole was completed with two 
8.75” assemblies. The first vertical assembly drilled to a depth of 8,485’ before being replace due to low 
ROP, the second vertical assembly drilled to a depth of 10,270’ (KOP). While drilling in the Mission 
Canyon, at a depth of 9,821’ the driller noticed that the mud volume was increasing. A flow test indicated 
that the well was taking on water. A cement bond log will be run at a later date, but as of this report, it is 
assumed that the cement job on the 9 5/8” casing string was poor and lead to water from the Inyan Kara 
flowing into the wellbore. To resolve the water flow for the time being, the drilling choke was engaged to 
increase pressure on the back side of the drill pipe and hold back the water flow. From 9,821’-10,270’ ~350 
psi casing back pressure was maintained to reduce the water influx.  
 
The curve assembly consisted of a Reed TKC56 PDC bit (#4), attached to a 2.38° NOV mud motor and 
Scientific Drilling MWD tools drilled to a depth of 11,148’ (casing point). At a depth of 11,325’ while 
attempting to slowly reduce flow with the drilling choke, the choke was accidently closed completely 
resulting in a dramatic increase in pressure. Shortly after this incident fluid losses we observed at a 
substantial rate. It is assumed that with the increase in pressure the Mission Canyon began to absorb fluid. 
From this depth to casing point there was a substantial amount of LCM pumped down hole. To keep the 
LCM in the drilling fluid the shaker screens were removed and not used until cement operations for the 7” 
casing began. The curve was successfully landed at 11,148’ MD and 10,786’ TVD, approximately 12’ 
below the Upper Bakken Shale on April 25, 2019. Seven inch diameter 32# P-110 intermediate casing was 
set to 11,130’ MD at landing.  
 
The lateral was completed using two 6” assemblies. The first lateral assembly drilled to a depth of 15,739’ 
before a trip was required due to an MWD failure. Prior to the MWD failure the decision was made to 
sidetrack due to the potential proximity to the Upper Bakken Shale (please see details below in the 
Geosteering portion of this report). The sidetrack was kicked off on the first attempt, at a depth of 15,620’. 
While replacing the faulty MWD tool, the bit and mud motor were also replaced. The second lateral 
assembly drilled the remainder of the lateral. The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B reached a total depth of 
20,860’ on May 3, 2019. 
Offset Control 
 
Offset well data can be found in the ‘Control Data’ section appended to this report. Offset wells were 
essential in providing control, making it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and curve landing 
target depth. The three primary offsets were, The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 
5300 11-31 4BR, the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H, and the Oasis 
Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 3B. By referencing the gamma signature of these 
offsets and using formation thicknesses, a model was formed for the target interval pinpointing a strategic 
landing.  Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in these offset wells were compared to 
gamma data collected during drilling operations in to successfully land the curve. 
 
Geology 
 
Sample evaluation began in the Otter Formation at 8,300’ measured depth (MD). Lagged samples were 
caught by Sunburst personnel in 30’ intervals through the vertical and curve, and 50’ intervals in the lateral. 
Rock samples were evaluated under wet and dry conditions using a stereo zoom binocular microscope for 
the identification of lithology including the presence of porosity and oil.  Only observed prospective intervals 
are described here, but detailed lithological descriptions for all formations are provided in the ‘Lithology’ 
appendix.  
 
The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian, Madison Group] was logged at 9,473' MD, 9,466’ TVD 
(-7,309' MSL). The Mission Canyon Formation is described as cream, 
tan, light gray, and light brown gray in color. Samples are 
predominately microcrystalline and are a firm mudstone. The 
limestone has an earthy, rarely crystalline texture.  Also noted in in 
several samples were trace fossil fragments. The limestone is 
argillaceous in part throughout this interval. In certain areas possible 
intercrystalline porosity was noted but there was no significant oil 
staining observed in samples. Throughout the Mission Canyon gas 
shows are promising, with an average background gasses ~360u with 
several connection gasses exceeding 1000u. It should be noted that 
prior to the drilling choke being used to hold ~350psi casing back 
pressure, gas show was much higher (~510u background gas) than 
those observed with the casing back pressure (135u background gas).

Mission Canyon. 
The Bakken Formation  
 
The Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian] was recorded at 10,963' MD, 10,759’ TVD (-8,602' 
MSL). Entry into this member is characterized by high gamma counts (>300 API), elevated background 
gas and increased rates of penetration. While drilling through the Upper Bakken Shale gas a background 
gas of 580u was observed, as well as several gas shows exceeding 800u. The distinct black shale is 
carbonaceous and petroliferous, as well as, hard and platy. Minerals including disseminated/nodular pyrite 
and trace calcite fracture fill was observed.  
 
The Middle Bakken Member [Mississippian-Devonian] was 
entered at 11,020’ MD, 10,774' TVD (-8,617' MSL). Samples in 
the Middle Bakken are predominantly a light brown, light brown 
gray, light to medium gray, silty sandstone. The silty sandstone is 
fine to very fine grained, and firm. The Middle Bakken typically 
contained sub-round to sub-angular grains. Samples are smooth, 
moderately sorted and poorly cemented by calcite. Rare to trace 
quantities of disseminated and nodular pyrite is present as was 
trace to fair intergranular porosity. Trace to rare light-medium 
brown, spotty oil stain was visible in many of these samples. 
While drilling the Middle Bakken background gasses ranged from 
~700 to 3500 units while several shows exceeded 4500u.

Geosteering 
 
Structure maps provided by Oasis Petroleum projected the structure would have an overall down dip 
averaging -0.50º. Below are the two nearest offset wells to the Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B. The Lewis 
Federal 5300 11-21 4BR (Figure 4), drilling west to east, ~0.30 miles north of the subject well, and the 
Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H (Figure 5), drilling west to east, ~0.20 miles south of the subject well. 
Although the nearby offsets all had an overall dip rate of -0.50º, the structure near a vertical section of 
4,700’ varied considerably. The Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H has a very consistent downward dip rate of 
approximately -0.50 throughout the course of the lateral. While the Lewis Federal 5300 11-21 4BR has a 
constant downward dip rate until ~4,700’ vertical section, where the structure abruptly dips down at a steep 
>2º for several hundred feet before flattening, reversing to a steep >1.5º up dip for several hundred feet, 
then returning to dip rate more similar to that of regional structure. In total the synclinal structure observed 
on the Lewis Federal 5300 11-21 4BR lasted for ~1,950’. The steering team recognized that if the structure 
on the subject well was to be irregular, and similar to the Lewis Federal 5300 11-21 4BR, that this irregular 
structure would be observed from 4,000’-7,000’ vertical section.

The 18’ target interval for the subject well is 9’ below the Upper Bakken Shale and 9’ above the Lower 
Bakken Shale. Prior to drilling out of the 7” casing it was determined that the C marker near the center of 
target and the featureless D marker in the lower portion of the Middle Bakken were to be the primary 
steering guides throughout the course of the lateral (Figure 6). For the first ~3,200’ of the lateral the 
structure observed was similar to regional structure, with dip rates of -0.15º to -0.85º being calculated. As 
the wellbore ascended above the target interval at ~18,300’ it became apparent that the structure was 
dipping down at a steep >1º rate. While drilling ahead the possibility of the structure dipping down at >2º 
was anticipated. As the MWD data collected from the survey at 15,651’ was analyzed it was realized that 
the structure had begun to dip down at a very steep >2º angle. At this time the steering teams profile placed 
the wellbore at the top of the target interval. Unfortunately, simultaneously as the structure began to dip 
down at a steep angle, the assembly also began to build a considerable amount of inclination (continuous 
inclination of 91.5º). At a measured depth of 15,739’ a stop card was pulled to assess the wellbores position 
within the Middle Bakken. At the time of the stop card there were no drilling parameters that would indicate 
an Upper Bakken Shale strike, and a bottoms up sample did not display any shale. When the data was 
assessed it was determined that the structure could possibly be dipping down at -2.35º, and that the wellbore 
could be as close as 1’ from the Upper Bakken Shale. To avoid a potential shale strike Oasis Petroleum 
decided that the safest course of action would be to pull back to a depth of 15,620’ and begin a sidetrack. 
As the sidetrack was being troughed the MWD tool failed and a trip was required. After the required trip 
the wellbore was successfully sidetracked on the first attempt. After the sidetrack the structure continued 
to dip down at a steep -1.4º to 2.3º until a MD of 16,125’. From a MD of 16,125’- 16,960’ the structure 
appeared to be relatively flat before turning up-dip for ~500’. In total the irregular synclinal structure was 
observed for ~3,150’ MD of drilling. This structure should be anticipated if more wells are to be drilled 
within the DSU in the future. Aside from a brief 340’ 
when the wellbore ascended above the target interval, 
the wellbore drilled within the target interval from the 
sidetrack point to 20,860’ TD. Over the course of the 
lateral, gamma markers throughout the target interval 
were relatively inconsistent and difficult to interpret. 
Two of the more dependable steering guides were a 
cool marker above the target interval, and a relatively 
warm marker near the top of the target zone. Although 
the cool was semi-consistent, due to the close 
proximity to the Upper Bakken Shale, it was not used 
as a primary steering guide. The warm marker ~4’ 
from the top of the target interval was a good 
reference for the wellbore’s position within the 
member but was not consistently observed while 
drilling in the upper portion of the target interval. 
Regardless of position in zone the assembly regularly 
built inclination on rotation. There did not appear to 
be any noticeable hard streaks or intervals that were 
more or less favorable in relation to ROP.

Federal 5300 21-31 5B. 
 
The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B had an estimated overall formation dip of approximately -0.54º. 
Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data, and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore 
in the preferred stratigraphic position within the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis 
representatives, the target interval was determined to maintain adequate distance from the shale and used 
as preferred drilling areas.  
 
The lateral was drilled in less than 5 days from casing exit to total depth, with two lateral assemblies. A 
total depth of 20,860’ MD was achieved at 05:20 hours on May 3, 2019. The wellbore was completed 95% 
within target, opening 9,730’ (measurement taken from uncased lateral portion) of potentially productive 
reservoir rock. 
Hydrocarbon Shows 
 
Gas was continuously recorded from 8,300’ to the completion of the lateral, along with the monitoring of 
free oil at the possum belly and shakers. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained 
near balance, this allowed gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. During the vertical, gas shows 
ranging from 10 to 1860 units were noted, against a 10.10 to 10.95 pound per gallon (PPG) diesel-invert, 
mud weight. Due to water influx from the Inyan Kara, casing back pressure was utilized from 9,821’ to 
11,148’. This increase pressure simulates a higher mud weight and reduced hydrocarbon shows. 
Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 700 to 3500 units, against a 9.4-9.45 PPG saltwater 
gel drilling fluid (Figure 7). Chromatography of gas revealed typical concentrations of methane, ethane 
and propane characteristic of the Middle Bakken (Figure 8). Sample cuttings were examined for 
hydrocarbon “cut” by immersion of trichloroethylene and inspection under a UV fluoroscope. Fluorescent 
cuts were generally pale yellow in color and had a diffuse habit at a slow to moderate speed.

Summary 
 
The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B is a well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle Bakken Member 
development program, in the Indian Hill prospect of McKenzie County, North Dakota. The project was 
drilled from surface casing to total depth in 17 days. Due to the wellbore proximity to the Upper Bakken 
Shale a sidetrack was utilized at a depth of 15,620’. A total depth of 20,860’ MD was achieved at 05:20 
hours on May 3, 2019.  The well-site team worked together to maintain the wellbore in the desired target 
interval for 95% within target, opening 9,730’ of potentially productive reservoir rock. 
  
Samples in the Middle Bakken Member are predominantly silty sandstone. These samples are light brown, 
light brown gray, light to medium gray silty sandstone. The silty sandstone is fine to very fine grained. The 
middle member typically contained sub-round and occasionally sub-angular grains. Samples are smooth, 
moderately sorted and poorly cemented by calcite. Rare quantities of disseminated and nodular pyrite are 
present as was trace to fair intergranular porosity. Trace to rare light-medium brown, spotty oil stain was 
visible in many of these samples. The overall hydrocarbon “cuts”, gas and hydrocarbon shows were 
encouraging and indicate an oil and gas rich system in the Middle Bakken Member. 
 
The well should be regarded as an engineering and geological success based on the combination of: 
 
• 
Maximum exposure to the target 
• 
Minimal days from re-entry to total depth 
• 
No shale strikes 
 
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B awaits completion operations to 
determine its ultimate production potential and commercial value.

LITHOLOGY 
Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC 
Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B 
 
Sunburst geologists caught 30’ sample intervals from 8,300’-11,148’ and 50’ sample intervals through the 
lateral to TD at 20,860’. Additional spot samples were caught through the vertical, curve, and lateral as 
needed. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope. Sample fluorescent cuts are 
masked by invert mud through 11,148’, at which time the drilling fluid was displaced to Salt Water. 
Quantifiers in order of increasing abundance are trace, rare, occasional, common and abundant. One set 
of sample cuttings were packaged and mailed to the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library, per 
state requirement.

Oasis Petroleum respectfully requests to amend the surface casing depth to 3300' MD (previously (2157') due to 
potential flowback In the Dakota formation. In order to counteract projected flowback at surface, Oasis needs to 
increase mud weight, and lowering the surface casing point will allow this to be performed safely. ADV tool will not 
be used. 
Attached are revised drill plans reflecting the amended casing points, cement volumes, and other related volumes.

Oasis requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under NDAC 
43-02-03-55. Oasis Intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a 
small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the 
Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations 
of the surface casing. Once the surface casing Is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the 
casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting Into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the 
location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APO. The 
undersigned states that this request for suspension of drllling operations In accordance with the Subsection 4 of 
Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using 
an Initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not Intended to alter or extend 
the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage In or under the 
spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding 
confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction If the well 
pad is located In a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site 
if the well ls not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

Well File # 28194 
 
Dear Lauri: 
 
   Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The 
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than 
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 31 & 32 T153N R100W.  
 
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to a drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding 
the entire location.  Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock 
disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site 
during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted.  OASIS 
PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location 
construction. 
 
Drilling pit 
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well 
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will 
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits 
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings 
pit.” 
 
Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines  
  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum 
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10084 E. 
 
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) 
   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the 
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to 
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may 
be waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information 
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other 
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the 
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification 
   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested 
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the 
Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal 
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are 
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a 
message if after hours or on the weekend.  
 
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells 
   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor 
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys 
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may 
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the 
operation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe 
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve 
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. 
 
Surface casing cement 
 
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi 
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.   
 
Logs 
 
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and 
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and 
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation 
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log 
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to 
digitallogs@nd.gov

RE:  Filter Socks and Other Filter Media 
 
 
 
 
Leakproof Container Required 
 
 
 
 
Oil and Gas Wells 
 
Dear Operator, 
 
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with 
exploration or production of oil and  gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all 
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations. 
 
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota.  The Commission is very 
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. 
 
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the 
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations 
are conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an 
authorized facility.  Such containers must be: 
 
leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container 
 
covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container 
 
placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container 
 
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but 
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. 
 
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production 
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste 
Management.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the 
solid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, 
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  
 
Thank you for your cooperation.  
 
 
 
Sincerely,
